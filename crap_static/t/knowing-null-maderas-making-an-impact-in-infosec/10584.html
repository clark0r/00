<h1>Welcome Back!</h1>
<p>Here with us today is the one and only <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/maderas">@maderas</a> !</p>
<p>Be sure to comment any further questions you have and to vote for our next guest in the Poll at the bottom.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
<h3>Professional Career and Advice</h3>
<p><strong>1. For starters, can you tell us a bit about yourself and your current role/job/work?</strong></p>
<p>I am a guy who believes that InfoSec/Hacking is my best chance to make the world a better place and leave/make an impact that outlives me.</p>
<p>I’m obsessed with making an impact upon the world; I believe that this art (hacking, by which I also mean Red Teaming/Penetration Testing) presents me with an opportunity to make this world a better place.</p>
<p>I think that to achieve all of the latter, I must endeavor to share all that I learn/experience to help this game evolve.</p>
<p>As the bar rises, those who work toward being the best they can be evolve as well.</p>
<p>I believe that if you are afraid to share everything you know, then you are not working hard enough.</p>
<p>Much of this experience originates from my career. Since January of 2011 I’ve worked as a Penetration Tester/Red Team Operator.</p>
<p>From the beginning, I have focused my skill set on real world, adversarial tactics. This involves a ton of extra study /prep on my part, as I need to track down the work/C2 of BlackHats in the wild study/train until I can emulate their tactics.**</p>
<p>For the last few years (and ever on into the future if I can help it) I’ve endeavored to only work in sectors where I believe I can make an impact that is meaningful to the world at large.</p>
<p>In the past, I’ve worked as the Cybersecurity Penetration Test and Vulnerability Assessment Lab for Schneider Electric and as Senior Red Team Operator/Penetration Tester for National Grid.</p>
<p>Currently, I am between gigs and doing volunteer work for Tutanota (pentesting their next e-mail platform) and running the <span class="hashtag">#CyberpunkisNow</span> project via Twitter, which seeks to create a dialogue between people around the world as to how technology continues to permeate our civilization.</p>
<p>I also release original InfoSec content by my Twitter account, which has grown rapidly and is now reaching millions of screens after only 3 months</p>
<p><strong>2. How did you first get into the field? (What was your first hack?)</strong></p>
<p>As long as I can remember, I wanted to be a hacker. I saw a cable news story about The L0pht when I was 12; as a son of Massachusetts, I realized that this was happening in my backyard. I could do this…</p>
<p>As for my first hack, when I was working a customer service gig I used to hack around on the Intranet. The buildings HVAC systems had default creds &amp; the Intranet itself was horribly insecure. I used to bring a live distro of Knoppix STD into work and practice there…nothing really malicious, just exploration.</p>
<p><strong>3. Can you give a rough map from your beginnings to where you are now?</strong></p>
<p>As far back as 2006-2007 I was screwing around with Knoppix STD in my former employer’s Intranet (with their permission) after work/on breaks (I was also maintaining AV/AM and that kind of stuff though it wasn’t my or anyone’s job).</p>
<p>By 2009 /2010 I was using Google’s bug bounty program as an excuse to practice vs. their networks/infrastructure; in December 2010/January 2011 I started doing consultant work and officially entered the world of professional InfoSec (where I have been professionally ever since in some form).</p>
<p><strong>4. What is one of the biggest struggles you overcame? And what’s been the biggest lesson you’ve learned in your career?</strong></p>
<p>My biggest struggle was also my biggest lesson: learning that in most big businesses, most of your managers/fellow employees arent going to care much about InfoSec. It will almost always take a back seat to profitability.</p>
<p>You have to realize that you yourself are there to help ensure the profitability/prosperity of your employer. Solutions are almost always going to be way more important to them then problems.</p>
<p><strong>5. Any advice for someone trying to land in a similar role/job?</strong></p>
<p>Understand the actual basics of Computer Science/Networking/It. You should endeavor to be able to exploit a system/network with the minimal resources possible.</p>
<p>I focused on living of the land from the very beginning of my career/training; it requires that you invest in actually learning things like Windows AD administration &amp; not cutting corners in you training/study, but it is a priceless skill set to have.</p>
<p>Learn defensive skills; spending some time as a Network Analyst is invaluable. Again, the solutions are almost always worth more to the customer/client/employer then the problems.</p>
<p>Make friends with IT &amp; System/Network Administrators if you are working an in-house position. Buy them coffee, talk to them often; there is usually a mutual interest in your and their interests that can result in an incredible skills/knowledge exchange.</p>
<p>You should learn to value all of the skill sets/experience of all the technology employees around you and endeavor to establish relationships based on mutual respect and skills/knowledge exchange.</p>
<p>If one of these employees is a greybeard Unix guru, they will provide insights into Linux/Unix Administration that are priceless (and almost all those I met could/would talk with me for hours, which was incredible).</p>
<p>We all suffer imposter syndrome; not knowing something is ok as long as you endeavor to learn it.</p>
<p>And ICMP/ping doesn’t have a dedicated port; managers running technical interviews love this question.</p>
<h3>Fun, personal stuff</h3>
<p><strong>6. Windows, Mac, or Linux What do you run?</strong></p>
<p>I run Linux; usually Devuan (Debian without System-D), Qubes or On the job, I am OS agnostic; whatever gets the job done. If possible, I will try to suggest/demonstrate the value of open source, but I am not going to be an obnoxious neckbeard about it.</p>
<p><strong>7. Programming language(s) of choice?</strong></p>
<p>Python 2.7, bits and pieces of many other languages. Mainly enough to change/alter code in exploits/tools to get it to do what I need and recognize vulns like deserialization.</p>
<p><strong>8. Do you use a mechanical keyboard? Is it ortholinear?</strong></p>
<p>No; I use plain old HP keyboards; I’ve seen some of the mechanical keyboards that have programmable tabs for scripts and stuff and would like to own one some day to build my Master Rig.</p>
<p><strong>9. Do you have any other hobbies or interests outside of infosec?</strong></p>
<p>Martial Arts; I’ve had 13 professional fights since 2005 in MMA/Muay Thai/Kickboxing. I’ve competed in kyokushin full contact tournaments as well; I’ve been training in some form of combative since I was 5 (my father was an amateur boxer).</p>
<p>I love reading; I read voraciously. I love film; anime…learning.</p>
<p>I am a huge proponent of self improvement, but not necessarily through self improvement gurus or teachings. I like the classics, like the Tao, Hagakure, The Book Of Rings…and challenging myself.</p>
<p>Challenging myself to know/exceed my limitations probably satisfies my definition of self improvement perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>10. Any other fun gadgets or hardware at home/the office?</strong></p>
<p>I’m a huge proponent of the Nexus 7 for Red Teaming/general computing given its power vs cost and ARM architecture; I will have material posted here about ti in 2019.</p>
<h3>Final Stuff</h3>
<p><strong>11. How’d you find 0x00sec?</strong></p>
<p>The NullByte exodus; I used to number that amongst sources I checked out weekly. I lurked this place forever before joining.</p>
<p><strong>12. Any other fun fact or detail you’d like to share with the community?</strong></p>
<p>I admire all of your work; I have infrastructure I’ve built out to keep an eye on things of interest. I don’t know if everyone here knows how rare/beautiful the level of courtesy/talent is here.</p>
<p><strong>13. Do you have any advice for new, up-and-coming hackers?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t cut corners; realize tools are just a means of helping to express skills/knowledge that there is no shortcut to ascertain. Your tooling no more makes you a hacker then buying a brush makes you a painter.</p>
<p><strong>14. Is there anything you’d like to say to the 0x00sec community?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for providing a home for me; I went it alone for a long time and realized the upper levels of ability lay in congress with peers. I was right; my skills have grown exponentially in the last 2 years.</p>
<p><strong>15. Can you give us a HEX for your hat “color”?</strong></p>
<p>No Hex needed. I’m Gray through and through. I have nothing against BlackHats; we aren’t opponents until a job or circumstance makes us so and then it is only temporary.</p>
<p>I’ve learned more from BlackHats/GrayHats then WhiteHat; most of it was knowledge I had to seek out/cultivate myself, but that is the best kind.</p>
<p>I am an ethical hacker not because it is a convenient term for marketing myself, or because a cert tells me what I am, but because my actions/work are governed by my ethics.</p>
