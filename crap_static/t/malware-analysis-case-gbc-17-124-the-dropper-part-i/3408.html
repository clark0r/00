<p>If you are reading this is because you have miserably failed to solve the <a href="../case-gbc-17-124/2980.html">Case GBC-17/124</a>. LoL, just kidding. The GBC-17_124 challenge was intended to show you something that you can easily find in the real world, but still easy to solve. Yes, real world stuff is not as fun as<a href="../challenge-collection-reverse-engineering-and-crackme/3027.html"> the challenge you usually find in this site</a> or in many CTFs out there. Malware developers does not write their malwares for you to have fun, their actual objective is to really make your live miserable, and the good ones really excel at that.</p>
<p>I’m not a malware analyst and, of course, I’m not a malware developer, however, software wise, these little guys are one of the most interesting programs that you can find out there (together with operating systems and AAA games). So overall, malware analysis is a very interesting topic and that is why you are reading this :). I guess.</p>
<p><em>If you are planning to solve the challenge, STOP READING NOW!</em></p>
<h1>Some random thoughts</h1>
<p>One thing I have always found funny about malware is its duality. Technically and educationally (which are the only valid points of view for us), a malware and a SW protection system are the same thing or at least pretty similar.</p>
<p>In both cases, there is a program that does something, and somebody puts some stuff around that program to make it difficult to (everybody not allowed) get full access to it. In one case, the objective is to make difficult the analysis of the program so malware analysts have a tough time figuring out what the program does and how to neutralise those protections.</p>
<p>In the other case, the objective is to make difficult the analysis of the program so crackers have a tough time figuring out what the program does and how to neutralise those protections.</p>
<p>The funny thing about this is that malware development is illegal, but SW protection is perfectly legal. Sure, I’m twisting reality a bit here. The main difference is what the program being protected actually does. There is nothing wrong with a program that calculates the payslips for a company, but it is very bad if, instead of that, the program crypts all the files in the computer and asks for a ransom. You will find similar packing, obfuscation and anti-debugging techniques in both tho.</p>
<p><em>Any lawyer in the room?. This is a good time to stand up and clarify legal situation about this topic!</em></p>
<p>So, the GCB-17/124 case does not really contain any real program, it is just the shell that can be used to protect something… This case is about the protection of such an hypothetical program (the payload herein), but the payloads themselves used in this challenge are just messages in the console.</p>
<p>After this long introduction let’s start with the stuff we are interested on.</p>
<p><em>Note: As I said I’m not a malware analyst, this is something I just do for fun. In case some actual malware analyst is in the room, please, do not hesitate to jump in and give some practical advice for the sake of our own education</em></p>
<h1>Taking a look to the Dropper</h1>
<p>The challenge provides you with a dropper and a network dump. Let’s start taking a look to the dropper:</p>
<pre><code>$  file dropper
dropper: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=0x2db02d0690c5d990b1f5d42bd0852f59143b6367, not stripped
</code></pre>
<p>Fine, a 64bits dynamic ELF not stripped. We are actually very lucky… you will not see many like this in the wild :). Let’s also take a look to the strings in the binary:</p>
<pre><code>$ strings dropper
(...)

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: ShadowHTTP/3.26 [SECURED]
Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: -1
GET / HTTP/1.1
User-Agent:BlackNibbles 5.32 xOS 2.1
Invalid number of parameters
socket:
connect:
Read %d bytes from net
/tmp/.a
open:
/tmp/.a %s &amp; rm /tmp/.a
(...)
</code></pre>
<p>I have only shown the relevant part here. In general, I like to take a look to the whole dump, but, for relatively normal programs (no heavy obfuscation stuff), the relevant strings are mostly stored in the <code>rodata</code> section. This means that we could get directly the strings we are interested on with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$  readelf -S dropper | grep -A 1 rodata
  [15] .rodata           PROGBITS         0000000000400fd0  00000fd0
       0000000000000123  0000000000000000   A       0     0     8
</code></pre>
<p>From this line we know that the <code>rodata</code> section is located at offset <code>0x0fd0</code> in the file and it has a size of <code>0x123</code> bytes. Now we can just run strings on that part of the file:</p>
<pre><code>$ dd if=dropper skip=$((0xfd0)) bs=1 count=$((0x123)) 2&gt; /dev/null | strings
</code></pre>
<details>
<summary>
For the LuLZ</summary>
<p>For the LuLZ! all in one line… can you simplify this?</p>
<pre><code>readelf -S dropper | grep -A1 rodata | tr -d "\n" | awk '{system("dd if=dropper bs=1 skip=$((0x" $5 ")) count=$((0x" $6 ")) 2&gt; /dev/null| strings")}
</code></pre>
</details>
<p>You can also take a look to the output of <code>readelf</code> and other tools, but overall there is nothing else special on this binary.</p>
<p>So far, what can we infer from the strings we have found?</p>
<ul>
<li>We see an HTTP request and also a response with doggy <code>Server</code> and <code>User-Agent</code> values. This suggest the dropper will use HTTP to transfer the actual malware or at least will pretend it uses HTTP.</li>
<li>The line <code>/tmp/.a %s &amp; rm /tmp/.a</code>, suggest that the malware will be dropped at <code>/tmp/.a</code> executed in the background and deleted just after that. We can also see that the malware receives at least one parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far so good. Let’s look at the dump.</p>
<h1>The network dump</h1>
<p>To look at the network dump the easiest is to use wireshark. Just launch it passing as parameter the capture file</p>
<pre><code>$ wireshark case-GBC-17_124.pcap
</code></pre>
<p>You will see something like this.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/f/f569f0a0e90d3720dd5a25a145d2bb5e57516056.png" width="690" height="405"></p>
<p>We can see a <code>SYN</code> packet at the top. That indicates a connection attempt. To see the data associated to that TCP dialog, right click on the first packet and chose <code>Follow TCP Stream</code> in the pop-up menu.</p>
<p>You will see the following.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/d/d0ea6257be524176e99e219b787d1eecdf15e46c.png" width="649" height="500"></p>
<p>This looks pretty much like a HTTP request to some server at port 8888. We can see that the client sends 4 bytes of data in the body of its <code>GET</code> request. The reply from the server seems to be a PNG image, but the MIME type does not match.</p>
<p>Let’s see what is in that image. First select only the server response part of the steam and also change the visualisation to Hex Dump:</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/0/09b9dad462863abda350d70b9b733872ef3fe6fa.png" width="649" height="500"></p>
<p>Now, take note of the offset to the beginning of the PNG (<code>0x6d</code> in this case) and switch back to <code>Raw</code> data before saving the data to a file named <code>png.dump</code>.</p>
<p>Now we can skip the HTTP header and take a look to our PNG.</p>
<pre><code>$ dd if=png.dump of=image.png skip=$((0x6d)) bs=1
</code></pre>
<p>Well, if you try to open the file or just run <code>file</code> against it, you will immediately note that we are not looking to an image… but something else.</p>
<p>The good news are that, somehow we have probably already extracted the malware sample from the network dump. The bad news are that we have to figure out how to get a usable sample out of that file.</p>
<h1>Analysing the Dropper</h1>
<p>The data in our sample is encoded/obfuscated. It does not look like a binary so we need to take a look to the dropper to figure out what it does to the data it receives from that doggy remote server before saving it to the disk.</p>
<p>I will be using STAN for this analysis, but you can use any tool you like. We will be basically looking to the asm so it does not really matter which tool you use to follow the explanation.</p>
<p>Let’s start looking to the main function:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">                                  main:                                           │
00400d0a:   55                      	push	rbp                               │
00400d0b:   48 89 e5                	mov	rbp, rsp                          │
00400d0e:   53                      	push	rbx                               │
00400d0f:   48 81 ec 58 04 00 00    	sub	rsp, 0x458                        │
00400d16:   89 bd ac fb ff ff       	mov	dword ptr [rbp - 0x454], edi      │; {ls_rbp-1108}
00400d1c:   48 89 b5 a0 fb ff ff    	mov	qword ptr [rbp - 0x460], rsi      │; {ls_rbp-1120}
00400d23:   64 48 8b 04 25 28 00 00 	mov	rax, qword ptr fs:[0x28]          │
00400d2c:   48 89 45 e8             	mov	qword ptr [rbp - 0x18], rax       │; {ls_rbp-24}
00400d30:   31 c0                   	xor	eax, eax                          │
00400d32:   83 bd ac fb ff ff 02    	cmp	dword ptr [rbp - 0x454], 2        │; {ls_rbp-1108}

</code></pre>
<p>This first code block basically checks that <code>argc</code> (the <code>ARGument Counter</code> parameter to <code>main</code>) is 2 in order to continue. Otherwise, it shows an error and exits as we can see below (the actual exit is under label <code>l13</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">00400d3b:   48 8b 05 9e 13 20 00    	mov	rax, qword ptr [rip + 0x20139e]   │;  0x6020e0 &lt;stderr@@GLIBC_2.2.5&gt;

<p>First it creates a socket (calling the <code>socket</code> function) and the it checks for errors. In case of error, a textual representation of <code>errno</code> is shown with a call to <code>perror</code> and the program exists. Otherwise, the socket gets stored at <code>rbp - 0x43c</code>. (<em>If you are using the <code>.srep</code> file provided in the hints to the challenge you will already see a name for that variable</em>).</p>

<p>This blocks is actually a <code>connect</code> call. It first sets up IP (<code>inet_addr</code>) and port (<code>htons</code>) to effectively call <code>connect</code>. Then it checks the error code and shows an error and then exit in case the connection failed. You can check the beginning of the <code>main</code> function and verify that <code>rbp - 0x460</code> contains the first parameter received by the program. So now, we know that the parameter expected by our dropper is the IP address of a server to connect to.</p>

<p>OK, this suggests that the <code>get_msg</code> function is the one that actually transfer the file. Why? . Because the piece of code above is printing to the screen the number of bytes transfer from the net using <code>rax</code> (the value returned by <code>get_msg</code>) as parameter. We indeed have to verify that, but that looks like a reasonable hypothesis</p>

<p>Now the socket connection gets closed an the file <code>/tmp/.a</code> is opened. You can now check <code>man 2 open</code> and decode the parameters to the syscall to verify that the file will be created with execution permissions… You’d be able to do that by yourself, but comment below if you experience problems.</p>

<p>The code above is actually writing the data in the file just created/opened. I will not go through this in detail as it is pretty straightforward and I leave it as an exercise to the reader. However, if you plan to go through the function, better wait until we analyse <code>get_msg</code> so you have more information to figure out what all those local variables are.</p>

<p>And finally, the file is closed and the command-line we found with the command <code>strings</code> gets executed by <code>system</code>. Now we can see that the <code>%s</code> in the format string, corresponds to <code>rbp+ 460</code> or in other words the IP address actually passed as argument to the dropper. So, the malware will also connect to the same server used by the dropper.</p>

<p>Looks like this paper was too long for discourse so you will have to read about <code>get_msg</code> in <a href="../malware-analysis-case-gbc-17-124-the-dripper-part-ii/3409.html">Part II</a></p>

<p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/silur">@Silur</a>,</p>
<p>Sure it is a lot easier from radare2 but <code>dd</code> is cooler (just kidding). I like to try to explain the basics (as far as I know the topic myself). Then when you use tools like r2 you know what it is actually doing (and you really get to really appreciate the fantastic work all that people is doing)…As a side effect you also get alternatives to work when the tools are not available and to react under “non-nominal” cases.</p>

<p>This is super interesting. I tried this, and failed, so this is nice to have <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png%3Fv=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I must say I am 100% a fan of these real world scenarios, a bit of realism goes a long way to making it more enjoyable. Knowing what I learn can actually be applied one day is an awesome feeling.</p>
