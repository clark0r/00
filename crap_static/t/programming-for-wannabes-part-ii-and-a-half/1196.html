<p>If you had read <a href="../programming-for-wannabes-part-ii/1164.html">Part II</a> of this series you may have missed a couple of details. Consider this post as a short addendum to Part II including those details.</p>
<p>The first you may have noted is that there was no ARM or MIPS code in there. Actually, the paper was already quite long and, to be honest, I thought it should be straightforward to repeat what we did for the x86 with any of those processors. However, I tried myself for the Lulz and I found some glitches that may be useful to mention.</p>
<p>So let’s go with ARM</p>
<h1>ARM system calls</h1>
<p>Calling a system call from ARM works is, conceptually, done in the same way that in the Intel processors. You have to set a specific register with the number of the system call you want to invoke and then get into kernel mode.</p>
<p>ARM defines 15 registers, named from <code>r0</code> to <code>r12</code>. The last 3 have special names and special functions, we will go into the details later in this course. For the time being we will only use the general purpose registers (those <code>r0</code> to <code>r12</code>).</p>
<p>So, the system call number goes into <code>r7</code>… yes, there is a reason, but it does not really matter now. Then the additional parameters needed by the system call goes into registers <code>r0</code> to <code>r5</code>.</p>
<p>With all this information and, taking into consideration that system calls follows the same numbering that the Intel 32bits, we can write our exit function like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">.text
.globl _exit

_exit: mov r7, #1
       swi #0

</code></pre>
<p>As it happened with the Intel processor, the kernel follows the default processor C ABI. This means that when you call a C function, the first parameter goes int <code>r0</code> and when you call a system call the first argument also goes in <code>r0</code>. That’s why we do not have to do anything to capture the parameter we pass to the <code>_exit</code> function from C.</p>
<p>I will reproduce the C code again, in here for your convenience:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int _start (void)
{
  int a = 10;
  int b = 20;

  a = a + b;
  _exit (a);
}

</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can proceed as we did with Intel, but we have to be aware that… <code>gcc</code> generates ARM 32bits opcodes and <code>as</code>, the assembler generates Thumb opcodes… at least that was what happen with my <code>gcc</code> and <code>as</code>. Thumb is 16bits long and… well you cannot just mix 16bits and 32bits opcodes directly. So there are two options to solve this problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Option 1</strong>. Force 32bits passing the compiler the <code>-marm</code> flag</li>
<li>
<strong>Option 2</strong>. Mark the assembler code as a Thumb function, using the <code>.thumb_func</code> directive before the declaration of your function.</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried both, but in this paper, let’s use option 1… I haven’t checked all the details for option 2 so I may be saying something stupid <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png%3Fv=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc -static -fPIC -nostartfiles -nodefaultlibs -nostdlib -marm -o c2-3-arm c2-2.c exit_func-arm1.s
</code></pre>
<p>As you can imagine <code>exit_func-arm1</code> is the assembly code for option 1. The one we shown above.</p>
<p>Now you can test your program in your Android Phone or in any other ARM machine (BeagleBone Black, BananaPi, Olinuxino, RaspberryPi,…)… To check it in your phone take a look to this paper (<a href="../improving-your-android-shell/886.html">Improving your Android Shell</a> ).</p>
<h1>MIPS system calls</h1>
<p>With MIPS I had a quite tough time. The toolchain for my test router used and old version of binutils and that caused me a lot of problems.</p>
<p>First one was that I couldn’t use the names of the registers but its number. MIPS registers are named in a more complex way:</p>
<pre><code>$0	      	$zero	        Hard-wired to 0
$1		$at		Reserved for pseudo-instructions
$2  - $3	$v0, $v1	Return values from functions
$4  - $7	$a0 - $a3	Arguments to functions - not preserved by subprograms
$8  - $15	$t0 - $t7	Temporary data, not preserved by subprograms
$16 - $23	$s0 - $s7	Saved registers, preserved by subprograms
$24 - $25	$t8 - $t9	More temporary registers, not preserved by subprograms
$26 - $27	$k0 - $k1	Reserved for kernel. Do not use.
$28		$gp		Global Area Pointer (base of global data segment)
$29		$sp		Stack Pointer
$30		$fp		Frame Pointer
$31		$ra		Return Address
</code></pre>
<p>(taken from <a href="http://www.cs.uwm.edu/classes/cs315/Bacon/Lecture/HTML/ch05s03.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.cs.uwm.edu/classes/cs315/Bacon/Lecture/HTML/ch05s03.html</a>)</p>
<p>We can see again how the last registers are used for special purposes. As I said, we will come to this in a future instalment. For now, we will just use <code>$v</code> and <code>$a</code> registers.</p>
<p>So, how do we invoke a system call on a MIPS processor?. Again, we have to put the system call in a register and go into kernel mode. The register for the system call is <code>$v0</code> or <code>$2</code> and the instruction to go into kernel mode is <code>syscall</code>.</p>
<p>In my case I found the syscall number, disassembling one of my test programs. Then I found that, at least for <code>SYS_exit</code>, this page seems to have the right numbers ( <a href="https://w3challs.com/syscalls/?arch=mips_o32" rel="nofollow noopener">https://w3challs.com/syscalls/?arch=mips_o32</a> ).</p>
<p>If I told you that parameters, as stated in the table above, goes into <code>$aX</code>, then you should be able to write your exit function… something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">.globl _exit
.text
	
_exit:  li $2, 4001
	syscall
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s go with the glitches I mentioned at the beginning. The first one is that… at least for my toolchain, the first function getting executed is <code>__start</code> instead of <code>_start</code>. It took me a while to realize that (even when the linker was complaining), those two underscores are difficult to see when it is late night. Therefore, we need to change our C code and change the name of our function from <code>_start</code> to <code>__start</code>.</p>
<p>The second one was really frustrating, and I haven’t completely understood what the problem is. Apparently, for some reason that I do not know, my toolchain cannot compile static binaries. Any attempt to do that will produce a binary that crashes on my router. I have to do some experimentation, but for the time being this is a mystery.</p>
<p>So, for MIPS, at least for me, I couldn’t go that far as I went for Intel and ARM. Even when the <code>exit</code> function gets substituted (actually I changed to name to something not in libc and the function got called properly) by our minimal system call. However, I didn’t manage to get completely rid of the libc.</p>
<p><code>$ mips-linux-uclibc-gcc -nostartfiles -o c2-2-mips c2-2-mips.c exit_func_mips.s</code></p>
<p>Even though doesn’t look like there is any libc dependency. <code>nm</code> only shows an undefined symbol:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$ nm n
00440414 A __bss_start
00400120 r _DYNAMIC
00440414 A _edata
00440414 A _end
004003c0 T _exit
00440414 A _fbss
004403e0 A _fdata
00400360 T _ftext
004403f0 A _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_
004483e0 A _gp
         U _gp_disp
004403e0 D __RLD_MAP
00400360 T __start
</code></pre>
<p>Anyway, I have found that this stuff becomes tricky with routers, specially if you do not have a toolchain that actually matches your router and also that, many of them run old and very stripped down version of linux that imposes additional constraints in the code.</p>
<p>Let’s finish with some numbers as we did with intel:</p>
<pre><code>c2-3-arm  320 bytes  (ARM version)
c2-2-mips 1.8 Kbytes (MIPS version
</code></pre>
<p>These values are after <code>stripping</code> the binaries. Not bad…</p>
<p>Well, this is it for ARM and MIPS… at least for me and for now <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png%3Fv=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>We have done a short journey from the C realm to the kernel border and we have found quite a lot of stuff in between. It is interesting to understand all this… it changes a bit the way you see the programs running in your computer. We use to think that a C program is pretty low level and it is very fast and optimized. We have seen a bit of what it goes into a C program… now, just think about what is in there when using a scripting language… <em>So many CPU cycles</em>…</p>
<p>In next part we will come back to general programming… maybe…</p>
