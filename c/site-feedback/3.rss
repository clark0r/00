            <p>Hey guys, this a diverse community of immensely skilled people. I’d like to suggest that the administrators create a brand-new category for paid partnerships, paid engagements, help requests and hiring roles.</p>
<p>I mean have you seen the job market these days  <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=12" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>This, in my opinion, will promote fresh development and enhance community members’ cooperation. I am aware that the moderators and admin staff will have a lot more work to do as a result of the increased number of posts.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you think of this idea.</p>

<p>We’re terribly sorry for the downtime we had <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/pray.png?v=12" title=":pray:" class="emoji" alt=":pray:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><br>
There was an issue in our host that, including the limited IRL time available to spend on it, resulted in this 5-day blackout! (damn, I thought it was just 3)</p>
<p>Me and forum daddy <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a> finally fixed the logging issue that was causing docker to crash. Also, thanks to <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/messede">@messede</a> for not letting me get sidetracked.</p>
<p>Sorry again, we’ll be fixing this issue automatically from now on.</p>
<p>Aight, back to <s>banning</s> moderating again!</p>

            <p>Not a Feedback but rather <strong>a suggestion to add a new feature</strong> to this site by introducing a broadcast box in the home page, similar to [ <strong>shoutbox in breached forums</strong> ].</p>
<p>Logged in users can chat with each other either in private or in public by using the box. It kept the last forums that I was part of in ie. until it was seized by the glowies, active and engaging a lot more in addition to surfing around the website to read/post topics.</p>
<p>What do you guys think ? <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=12" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Two thousand and twenty has been difficult for everyone and it’s definitely the most memorable year of the decade so far. The world paralyzed under the shadow of COVID-19, an unprecedented situation for the people of the last generations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, that didn’t stop 0x00sec from developing, with 2020 being probably the year we grew up the most as a community!</p>
<h2>Discord</h2>
<p>Our Discord server is slowly becoming the heart of our community. A little more than a year after we made our Discord server public, we have welcomed a load of new users and we are happy to have you everyone around! Here we connect with everyone, get to know each other and, of course, get to talk about Infosec, computer science and technology in general.<br>
Special kudos to <code>#malware</code> and the whole <code>reverse-engineering</code> section for being so active throughout the year! Shoutout to <a href="https://0x00sec.org/u/jeff">Jeff</a> <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> . We have some very talented hackers!</p>
<h2>Forum</h2>
<p>Although Discord is the place to chat and have more active discussions, it could never replace our forum. There lies our community’s knowledge with some AAA articles. Apropos, here are our top 10 most viewed articles:</p>

<h2>Security Incident</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, no one is perfect. And we definitely fall under this category.</p>
<p>Three months ago we became aware of a security misconfiguration in one of our s3 buckets. Thanks to a security researcher from <a href="https://thugcrowd.com/">ThugCrowd</a>, we were notified about this and fixed the issue as soon as possible. You can read more about it <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/0x00sec-security-incident-notification-september-30th-2020/23355">here</a>, in case you’re interested. Again, many thanks to ThugCrowd!</p>
<p>If you discover a security flaw in one of our systems then please, notify us so that we can to take action to fix it.</p>

<h2>Axiom</h2>
<p>Pry has been developing his baby axiom! It’s a dynamic infrastructure framework that allows users to easily spin up disposable hacking infra! Axiom has found a home in the <a class="hashtag" href="https://0x00sec.org/tag/axiom">#<span>axiom</span></a> channel on the Discord server and has been very active!</p>
<h2>Thoughts and plans for the future</h2>
<p>As our community is growing bigger we feel like our responsibility is also growing. We hope and plan to play a bigger role to the Infosec community in the future, by helping each other in our Infosec path. Our main goal is to have a highly skilled, safe and friendly environment for everyone to benefit- from beginners to seasoned pros. We can’t wait to see how the next year will unfold <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

          <title>0x00sec - Security Incident Notification - September 30th 2020</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[pry0cc]]></dc:creator>
          <category>0x00sec Announcements</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Dear 0x00sec Users,</p>
<p>We are writing to you with important information regarding a recent security incident involving your personal information from <a href="https://0x00sec.org">https://0x00sec.org</a>. We became aware of the incident September 7th, 2020, when a security researcher from Thug Crowd privately disclosed to us that our S3 bucket containing database backups was publicly accessible. The S3 bucket was publicly accessible for a total of 63 days, from July 6th - September 7th, 2020, and contained usernames, email addresses, direct messages and salted PBKDF2 password hashes.</p>
<p>[Although we are unaware of any actual misuse of your information, we are providing notice to you and other potentially affected users about the incident.]</p>
<h2>What happened?</h2>
<p>On July 6th we ran a routine update of Discourse that introduced a bug that overwrote images and mangled object prefixes (folders). The bug affected us because we did not separate buckets for uploads and backups. Instead, we used ACLs to allow public access to the entire bucket to store user uploads with the exception of a subfolder that blocks public access which we used for backups.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>Allow Public Access s3_upload_bucket: my-backups-bucket/</p>
<p>Block Public Access s3_backup_bucket: my-backups-bucket/backups</p>
<p>Immediately after the update, images started linking to invalid s3 objects causing 403 Forbidden errors to be returned. We decided to delete our s3 backups folder and restore from local backups. We then checked for backup files that might have allowed public access and didn’t find any.</p>
<p>What we didn’t know at the time is that using the AWS web console for searching s3 buckets does not search recursively and after the update, a new maintenance job intended to run solely on the contents of the backup bucket affected contents of the uploads because their values were the same. In consequence, folders and objects from /backups were copied to the parent folder with no ACLs restricting public access.</p>
<p>September 7th, 2020, Thug Crowd notified us of the exposure and we immediately isolated the environment by disabling S3 and locked off all ACLs to investigate further.</p>
<p>We deprovisioned and redeployed our containers on new infrastructure, created a new bucket with proper ACLs and restored our user database from a known safe backup. We removed s3 entirely from the backup process and moved to a local solution instead.</p>
<p>We continued our investigation of the issue as well as the possible impact to any data stored in the S3 buckets. The key thing was to ensure that we had a solid plan to add additional protections and a procedure for securing site backups. This included performing a server migration, SIEM tuning and extra logging enabled where possible. This was a time-consuming process but it was important to set this up properly to avoid any issues in the future.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the remediation activities, a full user password reset performed as a precautionary measure and all members notified.</p>
<h2>What information was involved?</h2>
<p>The information exposed relates to user data such as plaintext usernames, email addresses, direct messages, profile data and salted PBKDF2 password hashes. PBKDF2 passwords hashes, when salted, with a 10 character minimum password requirement like 0x00sec, are very <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4781/do-any-security-experts-recommend-bcrypt-for-password-storage">hard to crack</a>, however, still not impossible.</p>
<h2>What’s being done?</h2>
<p>As stated, we deprovisioned and redeployed our containers on new infrastructure, created a new s3 bucket with proper ACLs and restored our user database from a known safe backup. We added end-to-end encryption for direct messages and completely revamped our security posture by fine-tuning our SIEM and IDR, as well as enhanced our logging. A full password reset has also been enacted as a precautionary measure.</p>
<h2>What you can do?</h2>
<p>As a precaution we temporarily disabled all user accounts, the only action required is to reset your password to regain access.</p>
<h2>Where to find more information?</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to DM or email me at <a href="mailto:admin@0x00sec.org">admin@0x00sec.org</a>. I’ll do my best to respond in a timely manner.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>July 6th 2020, 10:25am</strong> - Same day, the bucket was searched for backups, S3 search is <em>not</em> recursive, Pry missed this and first backups were exposed from this point on.</li>
</ul>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/9/99a676af8e93e615365efef4c6a159e6b326aa41.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/lVfHnnPZqCxwldEdJKF0wUJr4C5.png?dl=1" title="Untitled"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/9/99a676af8e93e615365efef4c6a159e6b326aa41_2_690x374.png" alt="Untitled" data-base62-sha1="lVfHnnPZqCxwldEdJKF0wUJr4C5" width="690" height="374" srcset="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/9/99a676af8e93e615365efef4c6a159e6b326aa41_2_690x374.png, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/9/99a676af8e93e615365efef4c6a159e6b326aa41.png 1.5x, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/9/99a676af8e93e615365efef4c6a159e6b326aa41.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/9/99a676af8e93e615365efef4c6a159e6b326aa41_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>July 6th 2020, 11:47 am</strong> - Same day, images were now functional</li>
<li><strong>63 days passed</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>September 7th, 2020, 5:36 PM</strong> - ThugCrowd Reported Vulnerability to 0x00sec</li>
<li>
<strong>September 7th, 2020, 5:42 PM</strong> - The vulnerability was remediated. 0x00sec remediated the exposure within 10 minutes of reporting and entirely disabled S3 and locked off all ACLs to investigate further.</li>
<li>
<strong>September 12th, 2020</strong> Afternoon - Further investigation as to nature of the issue was performed, plans were made to add additional protections, site backups will no longer be made to any additional cloud platforms.</li>
<li>
<strong>September 26th, 2020 2:00pm - 11:45pm</strong> - Further planned remediation work performed including server migration, SIEM tuning, extra logging enabled where possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>September 30th 2020 5:00pm -</strong> Completion of planned remediation activities, full user password reset performed as a precautionary measure and all members notified</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is there any evidence these backups been obtained by anybody other than the security researcher who reported it?</h2>
<ul>
<li>No, all evidence currently suggests that we’re the first to catch this, however, no logging was configured on S3 as the bucket was only intended for public site images. 0x00sec has pulled logs for everything where possible, and 0x00sec have searched multiple S3 indexing tools.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What was exposed?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Usernames</li>
<li>Password Hashes (Salted PBKDF2, Min password length: 10 chars)</li>
<li>Email addresses</li>
<li>User DM’s</li>
</ul>
<h2>How long was this exposed?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The backups were exposed on the bucket for exactly 63 days after creation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who does this affect?</h2>
<ul>
<li>This only affects users with accounts on the forum, <a href="http://0x00sec.org">0x00sec.org</a>. As most 0x00sec users are on the Discord, and this is separate, this will not affect any Discord users.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What do I need to do about it?</h2>
<ul>
<li>All user passwords have been reset, all you need to do is reset your user password if you wish to regain access to your account.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What’s the good news?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Password hashes in use are quite strong, and the user direct message functionality is largely unused as most of the community use Discord - especially in the past year. This event has prompted an array of upgrades to the community infrastructure including encrypted direct messages (coming soon).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Extra Notes:</h1>
<p>When resetting your password, please check your junk box and wait up to 10 minutes as we have recently changed email providers.</p>
<h1>Extra Precautions:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Reset all user passwords</li>
<li>Extra monitoring on accounts for abuse</li>
<li>Extra logging in place (including all s3 &amp; image buckets just in case)</li>
<li>End-End Encryption (In-the-browser key generation and storage) for Direct Messages</li>
<li>Reconfigure S3 and removed backups entirely from external-cloud sources</li>
</ul>
<p>Update: We’re having some trouble sending notification emails to all the users, they will be arriving shortly. All user passwords have been reset, if you’re reading this all you have to do is request a new password to regain access to your account.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions, please email <a href="mailto:admin@0x00sec.org">admin@0x00sec.org</a> and we’ll reply as soon as we can.</p>

            <p>Hey all, sorry for my absence!</p>
<p>It’s great to see that this community is still up and running! The nostalgia rush I’ve gotten from reading through some old and new posts on here last night was intense! <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I’ve noticed that some resources in old posts and profiles don’t display photos anymore. I’ve attempted to attach screenshots to this post however, when doing so I got a popup saying “access denied”. Is there a problem with the service being used to store the uploaded images? Why are some pictures not affected by this? And most importantly, how can I help?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time!</p>

<p>This is an emergency announcement, you may notice some things are broken right now. There was a bug with the backup cleanup module and it wiped out a bunch of images.</p>
<p>If you notice anything is broken, please wait a few days and we should have everything resolved. We are working as fast as possible to fix any disruptions.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience.</p>

            <p>Hey 0x00ers!</p>
<p>We have been working on something really cool, and are bringing bi-monthly 0x00sec CTF exercises.</p>
<p>The purpose of this is to make very short, 10-30 minute exercises designed to teach you new techniques and get your hacker juices flowing <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>The challenges are supposed to be basic, and not extensive at all. Sharing on how to solve these during the open-challenge window is permitted and good hints are encouraged.</p>
<p>At the end of the day this initiative isn’t designed to make you feel dumb, isn’t designed to make you bang your head against a wall for hours on end, it’s literally supposed to give you a small lab environment to exploit a specific vulnerability.</p>
<p>Think of it as a quick fortnightly warmup.</p>
<p>Categories will range from a wide array of topics from Web, Linux, Forensics, Crypto.</p>
<p>Accounts can be made at <a href="https://ctf.0x00sec.org/">https://ctf.0x00sec.org/</a> and our first challenge is live!</p>
<p>We encourage you to take thorough notes and publish writeups after the challenge period has lapsed to help other people understand the techniques involved and to spread the knowledge.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for! Get hacking!</p>

            <h1>0x00sec 2019 Year End Review - Year 0x04</h1>
<p>Hi 0x00ers!</p>
<p>I hope you all have had a very happy holiday! Today, I want take a quick look back at the year of 2019 for 0x00sec, laugh about some of the good times and review some of the amazing content and achievements of this year by the community.</p>
<h2>Articles</h2>
<p>A core feature of the 0x00sec philosophy is to openly exchange information between members - the forums being an excellent medium for sharing.</p>
<p>This year there have been some incredible articles released, and here are some of the highlights we’ve picked out <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> If you think we missed one, let us know on the <a class="hashtag" href="https://0x00sec.org/tag/projects">#<span>projects</span></a> channel on the 0x00sec Discord.</p>

<h2>Trend Micro</h2>
<p>So an interesting part of the infosec community at large is drama. Some of it is terrible, some of it is funny, and some of it is just downright stupid.</p>
<p>In a research paper put together by Trend Micro, 0x00sec was portrayed next to other “English Criminal Underground Hacking Groups” and labeled as such.</p>

<h4><a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/autobof-a-journey-into-automation-exploit-development-and-buffer-overflows/13415">AutoBOF</a></h4>
<p>A nice idea born out of a passion to learn about buffer overflows and an OSCP journey.</p>
<p>From our very own <a href="https://twitter.com/0x00rain">@Rain</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR I wrote a program to automate buffer overflows. I talk about what buffer overflows are, why I made this program, and show all the code I used.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/coerchck-powershell-script-for-listing-local-admins/12987/">Coercheck</a></h4>
<p>An in-development PowerShell tool by <a href="https://twitter.com/jamestreichle">@PresComm</a>. Intended more for blue teams (as it requires administrative rights on target systems), Coerchck scans targets (single machines, subnets, ranges, or a mix of each) to search for local administrator accounts on Windows machines. The first in a series of PowerShell scanning tools intended for blue team enumeration.</p>
<h4>Karen</h4>
<p>I (<a href="https://twitter.com/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a>) have been developing a chatbot I call Karen. Karen lives in the 0x00sec Discord and can do many things like deploy DigitalOcean droplets, execute SSH commands, store history, and generate reverse shell payloads on the fly.</p>

<h2>Changes to 0x00sec</h2>
<h3>Public Discord</h3>
<p>This year was the first year that the 0x00sec Discord was made public! After moving away from a fully public IRC in 2018. There was a lot of uncertainty as to how the quality of the chat medium would be maintained in a public manner, however, it has been a really positive and active environment and has continued to be a treasured part of the community.</p>
<h3>Introduction of VIP</h3>
<p>This year we also introduced the <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/explaining-the-vip-status-on-0x00sec/12114">VIP status</a>. The VIP status is a way to both reward active and heavy contributors but also to recognize users as model community members and their position as a leader in the community. This has been invaluable in creating a curated list of good content automatically (more to come soon ;))</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>2019 has been an incredible year for 0x00sec! We want to extend a huge thank you to our frequent visitors, lurkers, friends and members that make this community what it is.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to see what we can do in 2020 <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Hello 0x00sec!</p>
<p>There seems to be a bit of confusion about the site and where certain things should go.</p>
<p>To clear up this confusion, we have renamed the Support category to Questions.</p>
<p>If you want to post a question, post it in the Questions category. This will suppress it from showing up on the main page, as many people viewing the site are trying to read articles or things that inform them.</p>
<p>You can see questions articles by going to the “New” button on the top bar.</p>
<p>If you post a question in anything other than Question, then your post will be unlisted or moved to that category. Of course - discussion topics may still be posted in Social &gt; Discussion.</p>
<p>Hope this clears things up!</p>

            <p>Hey 0x00ers!</p>
<p>If you’re a loyal member and visit regularly you will know about how 0x00sec now no longer has an IRC server. I receive probably 5-10 messages a week asking why IRC is down.</p>
<p>I don’t know if that’s because people just aren’t reading the forum posts, and maybe come back every now and then, but we do not have an IRC server anymore.</p>
<p>To find out why, read this:<br>

<p>We do however have a Discord Server, this is not a public utility of sorts, and is 100% invite only. In order to get access to the Discord, you will need to meet VIP rank. You can obtain VIP by contributing regularly with regular, high quality, well-written posts, and comments.</p>
<p>Showing a high level of regard for others, being helpful and generally being a positive influence in the community can easily get you VIP status.</p>

    Hi 0x00ers! 
If you’re an avid reader, you might have noticed that a few users have a small “VIP” circle on their avatar. 
For Example: 
[Screenshot%20from%202019-03-08%2009-43-52] 
If you see this, it means that a user has VIP status in the community. VIP status means that you get full access to the 0x00sec Discord Server, access to the 0x00sec HackTheBox team and the ability to work directly with other well-respected members on private internal projects. 
As a VIP you will get first exclusive-…

<p>If you already know about this, disregard this post, I just get an awful amount of messages on Twitter, here or elsewhere asking about IRC or Discord. Hopefully, this post will answer your questions about the current chat system.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>PS: If there are any references to the IRC server on the website, please DM me and I will remove/change those. I’ve done my best to remove every trace but I’m only human <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>EDIT: since Discord is not a public utility, it is purely at the mercy of the moderators and the VIPs as to which platform we use. We have chosen Discord because of how well it works for us. We do not need suggestions about other platforms, especially if you’re not a VIP.</p>

          <title>New Things to 0x00sec! (Patreon &amp; Stickers)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[pry0cc]]></dc:creator>
          <category>0x00sec Announcements</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi 0x00’ers!</p>
<p>I hope you’re having a great week! Over the past few months, we’ve added a few things that have been mostly common knowledge to VIP’s and other people in the inner community, but I wanted to make a quick update post so that everybody is on the same page.</p>
<h2>Stickers</h2>
<p>One new thing we’ve added is stickers, if you don’t know already, we do have official clothing/swag, which can be found at <a href="https://swag.0x00sec.org/">https://swag.0x00sec.org/</a>, something we do now recently have is stickers!</p>
<p>Check out the link below if you want some.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/tuxdope/works/32039509-official-0x00sec-stickers?p=sticker&amp;rel=carousel" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.redbubble.com/people/tuxdope/works/32039509-official-0x00sec-stickers?p=sticker&amp;rel=carousel</a></p>
<h2>Patreon</h2>
<p>In order to make supporting the community easier, we have also created a community Patreon. Our running costs are mostly fulfilled by generous financial supporters like <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/anon3236228">@anon3236228</a> and kind sponsors like <a href="https://navisec.io/">https://navisec.io/</a>, however, it does cost us when we arrange events like the CTF’s and we are always trying to make our remuneration for community member’s hard work, better and more generous.</p>
<p>All funds from the Patreon will go to buying things for the community, running costs, and CTF prizes. We will not ever pocket money donated to the community, and will always ensure that 0x00sec is ad-free and free to use forever.</p>
<p>We will never take money in order to elevate one’s position in the community, and so if you do donate don’t expect any special treatment. A core philosophy at 0x00sec is one of merit, and receiving money in order to elevate somebody would not align with that at all.</p>
<p>If you just want to support us from just 1 dollar a month, the entire community thanks you hugely! If you just want to consume and lurk, then that is also completely okay! Think of the great things we could do if everybody gave just a dollar a month, we’d be able to send people to conferences, sponsor projects, support developers and so much more!</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Dear 0x00sec-Community,<br>
dear friends and buddies,</p>
<p>as you noticed I was working on a project for the last year. It was and still a vast project.<br>
Introduction</p>
<p>I joined this awesome community in Oct. 2017. In my opinion, it was one of my best choices that I ever made. It sounds crazy, but you’ll understand why shortly. At that time I was working toward getting my OSCP. There were moments where I got stuck. During these moments, talking to you guys motivated me again and again. You gave me the motivation and support I needed to pass my OSCP.<br>
Thank you for that. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Especially big thanks to: <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/ricksanchez">@ricksanchez</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/zsec">@zSec</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/fraq">@fraq</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/lkw">@lkw</a></p>
<p>Moreover, I want to show you how much I appreciate it.</p>
<p>As I already said in my introduction topic: <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/introduction-cry0l1t3/3920">https://0x00sec.org/t/introduction-cry0l1t3/3920</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>…In return, the first thing I want to do is to add a big post for newbies like me, what and how you should learn for InfoSec to help them out, make it easier to learn for it to push the InfoSec area at all. …</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a guy who keeps his word. So I started the Penny-Guide. I created a few topics, and then I got a better idea. That was the moment where the project was born.</p>
<p>I collected the ideas, structured them and organised it in a significant way. A few weeks later I decided to talk to our admins (<a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/fraq">@fraq</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/ricksanchez">@ricksanchez</a>) and present them my idea. To be honest, I was really nervous. I didn’t know how the founders and admins will react.</p>
<p><em>By the way, at the moment we’ve got a content size of more than 36.000 lines of crucial points, and it’s growing.</em></p>
<p>But like I learned from <strong>Offensive Security</strong> I decided to <strong>Try Harder</strong>®.<br>
We created a conversation where I presented my idea. Their reactions really surprised me.</p>
<p>Reactions of <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/ricksanchez">@ricksanchez</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Dude, this is incredible. I want to be part of this so bad. So let me know exactly what you need from me.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reaction of <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/fraq">@fraq</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Okay, I have FINALLY had some time to sit and read through this and I’m personally blown away.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me present to you…</p>
<h2>------- The official <strong>Company</strong> part of the <strong>0x00sec Community ! -------</strong>
</h2>

<hr>
<h2>What will this company do?</h2>
<p>There are four different services I will offer (first only in Germany):</p>
<ol>
<li>Private Tutorings</li>
<li>Workshops</li>
<li>In-House Training</li>
<li>Penetration Tests</li>
</ol>
<h2>Private Tutoring</h2>
<p>These private tutoring online sessions will be 1-on-1 Penetration Testing live training (2 or 4 hrs at once) for nine different topics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning Process</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>Information Gathering</li>
<li>Vulnerability Assessment</li>
<li>Exploitation</li>
<li>Web Exploitation</li>
<li>Password Attacks</li>
<li>Scripting</li>
<li>Methodology</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, there are two different types of certifications:</p>
<ol>
<li>Course certification for each topic</li>
<li>SHELL AFFECT CERTIFIED INTERMEDIATE ( <strong>SAC-I</strong> )</li>
</ol>
<h2>Certification Process</h2>
<p>Also, I created two different versions to get certified as <strong>SAC-I</strong> <strong>(Exam Lab - Under construction)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The first</strong> version was designed for beginners. It includes the completion of all courses with one hour (except for Methodology exam) of self-designed practical presentation with practical examples. The methodology exam will take 9 hours in the lab which was designed by <strong>HackTheBox</strong> where the student will get access to three boxes and the student has to root at least two of them.</p>
<p><strong>The second</strong> version I designed for experienced students. To not waste time and money they can purchase the SAC-I Certification. This certification will take 12 hours and is separated into two different parts. The first part will include eight presentations. Twenty minutes for each topic with practical examples. The second part will also be performed in the lab with the same requirements.</p>
<h2>Workshops &amp; In-House Training</h2>
<p>These workshops will only be performed in Germany for now. The duration of the workshops will be for three days.<br>
The maximum amount of students will be 10. In these workshops, I will teach the students all the necessary knowledge they need to become a good Penetration Tester. The entire workshop will be 80% practical.</p>
<p>Here is the room where the workshops will be performed:</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/e/e327ff9c9c9b847dc4ac3b44d2add202c13cb1ac.jpeg" alt="room" data-base62-sha1="wpw55M3ecezergLde1G6A4Y7xO4" width="690" height="327"></p>
<p>To show you guys that I really want to improve your skills, I will sponsor in each workshop and In-House training these products:</p>
<ul>
<li>1x Penetration Testing with Kali Linux (<strong>PWK</strong>) from <strong>Offensive Security</strong>
</li>

          <title>Changes coming to 0x00sec for 2019</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[pry0cc]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello 0x00ers.</p>
<p>Today we come to a new chapter in the life of 0x00sec.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed the new VIP status on a few individuals, we have actually been testing how it works so that we can fully facilitate the sale of 0x00sec in order to benefit the community and allow a more corporate, professional manner of working within 0x00sec.</p>
<p>In the next two weeks, we’re going to be facilitating the sale of 0x00sec to a large entity which is not yet to be named.</p>
<h3>New things include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paywall of premium content</li>
<li>Advertising to fund the community and fill the pockets of the corporation</li>
<li>Monthly-subscription based model for VIP’s ($20 per month)</li>
<li>Identity verification requirement (Passport &amp; utility bill scan required for each member to contribute)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Mainly, I’ve become bored as the founder of 0x00sec and have decided to pursue my life-long dream of becoming a male burlesque dancer. I think you all are going to love these new changes.</p>
<p>If you’re looking forward to this! Please comment below and let us know!</p>
<p>EDIT: This is an April Fools Joke. See the comments.</p>

          <title>Explaining the VIP Status on 0x00sec</title>

            <p>Hi 0x00ers!</p>
<p>If you’re an avid reader, you might have noticed that a few users have a small “VIP” circle on their avatar.</p>
<p>For Example:<br>
<img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/f/f78f7e4c998c462f038c91b30cf3c643fef0610e.png" alt="Screenshot%20from%202019-03-08%2009-43-52" data-base62-sha1="zk1mPJXguqKR9mWiZA3t075TQRM" width="415" height="109"></p>
<p>If you see this, it means that a user has VIP status in the community. VIP status means that you get full access to the 0x00sec Discord Server, access to the 0x00sec HackTheBox team and the ability to work directly with other well-respected members on private internal projects.</p>
<p>As a VIP you will get first exclusive-access to new 0x00sec things as well as have the opportunity to be involved in community decision making.</p>
<h1>How do I become a VIP?</h1>
<p>To become a VIP you need to show value through your contributions on the forum by helping people and taking part and adding value in community discussions. It is not a case of if you’re the smartest person, or if you make the coolest things, but it’s a case that you put a lot of effort and pride into your part in the community.</p>
<p>Examples of people who have gained VIP status in just a few weeks by their involvement include <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/tr4cefl0w">@tr4cefl0w</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/prescomm">@PresComm</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/baud">@Baud</a>, and <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/vict0ni">@vict0ni</a>.</p>
<p>Things such as writing quality articles go a long way in showing you value the community but also taking part in weekly CTF challenges and weekly HackTheBoxes is important.</p>
<p>Have any questions on this? Let us know in the comments!</p>
<p>Happy Hacking 0x00ers <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

          <title>[Admin] Coming Soon: A New Way of Doing Business</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[fraq]]></dc:creator>
          <category>0x00sec Announcements</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As we all know, communities grow and change, reflecting the path they’ve already traveled, the members who comprise them, and where they intend to go; our very own 0x00sec is no different. In the past few years, pry0cc and I have had the privilege of helping navigate all this growth and change with all of you. From our small, ragtag group of members who emigrated from Nullbyte to our short-lived (and possibly doomed-from-the-start) podcast, to our CTFs, and everything in between, this has been one heck of a great ride. And by no means is it stopping here!</p>
<h3>Two worlds</h3>
<p>As admins, pry0cc and I strive to build healthy community. While we aren’t perfect, we do seek to constantly observe, improve, and remediate problems where we see them. However, one problem has always eluded us. We noticed roughly a year or so ago that the IRC and the forum were becoming different communities altogether. Different people, different cultures, and a different <em>ethos</em> entirely. As we worked to try and reconcile this, we attempted several different solutions, but none of them really <em>worked</em>. Finally, recently, we realized that the IRC and the Forum had just become two completely separate communities who happened to share a domain name and administrators. This wasn’t inherently wrong or broken, but rather the result of growth and maturing in both places.</p>
<p>We also recognize that many people here have close ties to both the forums and the IRC, but many more are here almost exclusively for one or the other. We want chat to be productive conversation centered around 0x00sec’s values of building up newcomers, promoting awareness of information security, and producing awesome hackers, projects, and people. To that end, pry and I have decided to rearrange how 0x00sec’s chat and forums operate to accommodate the natural pattern we see emerging.</p>
<h3>A new community</h3>
<p>This is not a revolt, revolution, or coup. It’s not a rejection of 0x00sec. Instead, we have decided that 0x00sec’s official chat medium will move to Discord. I know that this is a move that we’ve debated in the past and that I have been very vocal about in my opposition. This is also why we have decided that the IRC will continue on mostly in its present form, but under a new name and with some small tweaks to the rules and CoC. The IRC server will no longer be official 0x00sec, nor will it be part of the 0x00sec networks or infrastructure. It will become a new community altogether, partnered with 0x00sec, but stripped back to the bare minimum. For the next few months, you will be able to access the new IRC server at either the old address, <a href="https://0x00sec.org">irc.0x00sec.org</a>, or the new address, <a href="https://0x00sec.org">irc.secops.space</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned, chat for 0x00sec will live on in the form of Discord. However, instead of being a “public utility”, as the IRC was, it will be more curated and members will be added selectively based on merit and recommendations from other members in good standing. This means it will be invite only. More details on how this will work are forthcoming.</p>
<h3>Changes in governance</h3>
<p>As communities split and reorganize, a change in leadership is also essential. In our case, new leadership and organization is necessary. As for 0x00sec, pry0cc will continue to be your BDFL. For myself and my involvement with 0x00sec, I will become an Administrator Emeritus, retaining my privilege but stepping out of the day-to-day management. I’ll still be present, involved, and chatting with all of you, but my attention will be primarily focused on the new community we are forming–at least for the time being. Along with me, Nugget/Daemon will be running the new community and we will be appointing a first round of staff while we determine the best way to govern. Our philosophy will be to keep a light touch, intervening as little as possible.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, we feel that the IRC and the forum have both grown, matured, and flourished in wonderful ways. It’s time for one of us to “leave the nest.” After some discussion, pry and I agree that it’s time for the IRC to become its own community under its own name and rules, free to forge ahead and continue making the next generation of hackers.</p>

          <title>Introducing: A Light Theme for 0x00sec!</title>

            <p>Hello, 0x00’ers!</p>
<p>As we’re a hacker forum, our colour scheme and the interface has taken its roots in more traditional hacker/programmer/tech culture, which is generally speaking, dark (<a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-programmers-work-with-dark-backgrounds#">Quora</a>).</p>
<p>Maybe it’s something to do with the stereotype of hackers working at night, or in the dark, which has, in turn, influenced our theming decisions to be mostly dark.</p>
<p>Ever since we first released <a href="http://0x00sec.org">0x00sec.org</a> to the public, it has had a grey, dark interface, which has been mostly loved by the community.</p>
<p>However, there have has been some controversy as to the appeal of a dark theme, and a few have shown interest in a light theme for 0x00sec. This is completely understandable since aesthetics is 100% subjective.</p>
<p>If you’re among these people, then today is your lucky day, as we’re officially releasing a light theme for 0x00sec!</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/48da6cb2811308d430c9170da96662d18627a51f.png" alt="43" data-base62-sha1="aoulJ09UYdbmgUFdtxjBET6GXz9" width="690" height="431"></p>
<p>This can be selected from <a href="https://0x00sec.org/u/yourusername/preferences/interface">https://0x00sec.org/u/yourusername/preferences/interface</a> or</p>
<p>Your Profile &gt; Prefrences &gt; Interface</p>
<p>We’ve also chosen a new code highlighting scheme to go with the new light theme, so your code highlighting will look good too <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>What do you think of the new light theme? Are you a dark theme or a light theme person? Let us know in the comments!</p>

          <title>0x00sec Gitlab Server poll: Keep or Decommission?</title>

<p>Hey folks, L0k1 here.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed that our Gitlab server hasn’t had any action in the last month or so. I was thinking of removing the server, and re-provisioning the box for something else. I will  leave the choice up to the community.</p>
<p>If so chosen, I will leave the Gitlab up for 30 days so all members can retrieve their projects. I will be making a backup of the server, and keeping it in safe storage in the event I decide to bring the gitlab back up again.</p>

          <title>IRC Maintenance: 5 May 2018 (You should read this)</title>

            <p>As users, you don’t often get a peek behind the curtain of what we do to maintain the site and the IRC server. Typically updates and upgrades are fairly seamless, and that’s a good thing. However, we do have a change planned this weekend that will be disruptive, so heads up:</p>
<h2>THE IRC SERVER WILL GO DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE ON SATURDAY, 5 MAY 2018 from 1600-2000 GMT</h2>
<h2>ALL NICK REGISTRATIONS WILL BE RESET.</h2>
<h2>ALL CHANNEL REGISTRATIONS WILL BE RESET.</h2>
<h2>YOU WILL HAVE TO RENEW YOUR REGISTRATION.</h2>
<h3>What’s changing?</h3>
<p>In short, we are upgrading the stack to a new architecture, updating to newer versions of some of the infrastructure, and making things a little more resilient.</p>
<p>We’re also adjusting how we handle the <a class="hashtag" href="https://0x00sec.org/tag/0x00sec">#<span>0x00sec</span></a> channel, but more announcements on that to come.</p>
<p>On behalf of the 0x00sec staff,<br>
