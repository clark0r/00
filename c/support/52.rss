            <p>So I’m in a situation where Responder could be useful but I somehow remember hearing that i could take down the network with the LLMNR poisoning.</p>
<p>Would running Responder WPAD to certain targeted machines pose a real risk of taking down the infra?</p>
<p>thanks!<br>

          <title>How does malware utilize tor?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[jasper]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So, there is quite a lot of malware nowadays that use the tor network to communicate with c2 servers.<br>
From what I see is they host their c2 server under a .onion domain and then they hardcode tor “proxies” into the malware which is uses to connect to which will then allow it to send data back to the c2 server.</p>
<p>Now when I asked people about how they get the “proxies” I was told they are not really proxies but that is what they look like<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/b/fb4cba310de9104eade8f87788e8f80bbf655a5d.jpeg" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/zR6eq4koYi2pNxwq0fy2I4VdduZ.jpeg?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/b/fb4cba310de9104eade8f87788e8f80bbf655a5d_2_690x426.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="zR6eq4koYi2pNxwq0fy2I4VdduZ" width="690" height="426" srcset="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/b/fb4cba310de9104eade8f87788e8f80bbf655a5d_2_690x426.jpeg, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/b/fb4cba310de9104eade8f87788e8f80bbf655a5d_2_1035x639.jpeg 1.5x, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/b/fb4cba310de9104eade8f87788e8f80bbf655a5d.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/b/fb4cba310de9104eade8f87788e8f80bbf655a5d_2_10x10.png"></a></div><br>
As you can see to me these look like proxies, now I know the tor project themselves every 20minutes has a page that auto updates of the latest tor exit nodes but my question is how are they getting the port number so they can route traffic through them too?<p></p>
<p>Now I was able to speak to someone once who made malware that used this and they simply said to me “They are free online, anyone can incorporate this into their malware” but he would not tell me where people get them from x_x</p>
<p>Anyone got any ideas at all?</p>

          <category>Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have read many stories about the most dangerous hackers/hacks and events that had happens in the past. And something that confuses me is how much networking is required? if any?</p>
<p>does every hacker understand Networking in full details? if we look at CCNA, what part of the stuff in there is important for a person to become a dangerous hacker? if we take CCNA as in example again there is alot of stuff that you dont need as a hacker correct? and i guess you dont need everything am i correct on this or not? i have also read that some hackers have caused millions of dollars in damage how so? do they just encrypt everything?</p>
<p>as of right now, i am watching a CCNA course on youtube, while doing the packet tracer labs that comes with it, and i need some advice, am i on the right path as a beginner/new to the IT world? what should be my next Step?</p>
<p>-I hope that anything of what i wrote made any sense, i will be active in the comment section</p>

            <p>I came across this page on the darkweb, someone is looking for a hacker who can hack corprorate email addresses.</p>
<p>Would that even be possible? Are there not enough security systems in place today to make this pretty much impossible. I can imagine they would also need to log in to the email accounts for a long time to get the info which makes it even more unlikely.</p>

            <p>How would a person go about hiding the true file type of a file? For example, let’s say I have a folder full of confidential information. I make an encrypted ZIP file, and change the file type to .null. However, if I run the <code>file</code> command, it still shows up as a ZIP file. Is there anyway to truly hide it?</p>

          <title>Jailbreaking T2 Chip</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Ph03n1x_Crus4d3r]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Beginner Guides</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I haven’t seen much in the way of jailbreaking, or Apple security in general. As that is that I’ve been focusing on a lot recently, I will be making posts from time to time about it, as well as tutorials.</p>
<h2>What is the T2 Security Chip</h2>
<p>The Apple T2 is a trusted security chip. It secures essential features, such as Secure Boot, Activation Lock, Touch ID, encrypted data storage, etc.</p>
<p><strong>How does Apple T2 security chip work?</strong><br>
The T2 chip has control over the MacOS boot procedure. It makes sure everything that runs on the Mac hardware is Apple-approved. Its work begins as soon as a power button is pressed on your Mac computer and lasts until you see MacOS desktop. In other words, one of its primary functions is to verify that Apple has signed your OS and boot loader. The T2 chip, which runs a software called BridgeOS (heavily modified version of WatchOS) never turns off, except for when the battery is dead (obviously).</p>
<p>The T2 is also responsible for all encryption data on the hard drive. In previous Mac versions, this function was performed by CPU, which slowed down the Mac as a whole. By moving these features to the T2 Chip, Apple has significantly improved the newer Mac’s performance, as well as allows for the security of TouchID. The fingerprint scanner in these devices gives a user a quick login option and approves the admin-level requests.</p>
<p>It also handles verification requests from different apps. The T2 Chip makes sure that no applications get access to your fingerprint information through Touch ID. When the verification is requested, the Apple T2 Security chip compares the fingerprint with data secured in the enclave coprocessor and notifies of the result.</p>
<p>The T2 is based on the A9 iPhone ARM processor, which makes it vulnerable to the same checkm8 exploit that Apple devices with A6-A11 processors are. I will be making a separate post as to how the checkm8 exploit actually works, and how it was integrated into checkra1n, the tool for jailbreaking the vulnerable devices.</p>
<h2>How to Jailbreak T2 Chip using Checkra1n</h2>
<p>Before you go about jailbreaking the T2 chip, you first need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mac with T2 chip capable of being jailbroken</li>
<li>Another computer running MacOS (NOT an M1 Mac)</li>
<li>USB-C to USB-C cable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download the latest checkra1n software on the MacOS you are not jailbreaking. This can be done by visiting the official site <a href="https://checkra.in" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>, or, if using Homebrew, by simply typing <code>brew install --cask checkra1n</code></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Put your Mac in DFU mode. This is a manual process that can take some time and effort to get right. I created a quick guide on my website, linked <a href="https://sh4d0wph03n1x.github.io/dfumode.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> As of right now, the GUI version of checkra1n does not support T2 jailbreak. As such, we have to use the cli version. In order to do so, open the terminal, and type <code>/Applications/checkra1n.app/Contents/MacOS/checkra1n -c -v</code></p>
<p>This will open checkra1n in cli mode and it will start searching for a DFU device. Once one is found, it will complete the jailbreak, and you have root access of your T2 chip! Sometimes, checkra1n with throw error code 20. If so, just relaunch checkra1n until it says <code>Bootstrap already installed</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> SSH into your T2 chip by iproxy.<br>
<code>iproxy 2222 44</code><br>
Do NOT close the window, just open a new one, and type:<br>
<code>ssh root@localhost -p 2222</code><br>
with the root password of <code>alpine</code>. You now have an SSH shell into your chip!</p>
<h2>What can I do with this?</h2>
<p>Now is time for some practical examples of what can be done with a T2 chip jailbreak. The issue is that this is where ALL of Mac’s security is, meaning that the drive can be unencrypted, a malicious EFI could be installed, etc. There was a PoC of a BridgeOS keylogger listening to MacOS at all times. Since it was considered completely trusted by MacOS, it could not possibly be detected by the user. I am doing more and more research and testing every day, and will post updates of cool things you can do as I go along. I will, at some point, be posting how to change the boot sound on Mac by using this method. Thanks for reading!</p>

            <p>Hello,<br>
I need security experts advice about designing a secure local network and I’m thankful if anyone share his\her ideas.<br>
Consider a local network with 1000 clients. This LAN connected to the Internet and use a gateway to share the internet to to the clients and has below components:<br>
1- Some servers (DNS, DHCP, File Server, Active Directory, Fax Server) that are Virtualized.<br>
2- NAS Storage.<br>
3- MSSQL Server.<br>
4- VOIP Server (MITEL).<br>
5- Web Server (Apache and IIS).<br>
This network use VLAN for each floor and my questions are:<br>
1- Which security architecture is good for protecting this LAN from the outside threats? I googled it and found some architecture, but I’m not a security expert and I don’t know which is good. I’m thankful if anyone share a diagram.<br>
2- For protecting internal servers which tools must be considered? For example, IDS/IPS, Honeypot, Log server, SIEM and etc.<br>
3- Which application is good to monitor operating systems Vulnerabilities?</p>
<p>Please share your ideas.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

          <title>How to setup high interaction honeypot?</title>

          <category>Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Context.<br>
Currently I have a honeypot that runs static html page and all POST request are captured and username and password field is extracted to send an alert on attack.</p>
<p>Problem?<br>
Now I want more functions to it, I don’t want to run container based solutions cause I want to scale it. Possible solution I had to get all requests process it through set of rules and realize if it is XSS, CSRF, Injection etc etc. But this has some limitations that zero days might slip by. Any suggestions? On how to setup web honeypots to catch all sort of attacks?</p>

            <p>hii everyone, hope your good.<br>
so i am trying to hook messageboxA() function:</p>
<pre><code>/*
** Simple MessageBoxA hook using the classic 5 byte relative jump technique without a         
trampoline.
** Instead of bypassing the hook in the proxy function when passing execution to 
MessageBoxA, we
** will simply re-write the original bytes, unhooking the function.
*/

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;Windows.h&gt;


#pragma comment(lib,"user32.lib")

char saved_buffer[5]; // buffer to save the original bytes
FARPROC hooked_address = NULL;
typedef int(__cdecl* MYPROC)(LPWSTR);
// The proxy function we will jump to after the hook has been installed
int __stdcall proxy_function(HWND hWnd, LPCSTR lpText, LPCSTR lpCaption, UINT 
uType)
{
std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello from MessageBox!\n";
std::cout &lt;&lt; "Text: " &lt;&lt; (LPCSTR)lpText &lt;&lt; "\nCaption: " &lt;&lt; (LPCSTR)lpCaption &lt;&lt; 
std::endl;

// unhook the function (re-write the saved buffer) to prevent infinite recursion
WriteProcessMemory(GetCurrentProcess(), (LPVOID)hooked_address, saved_buffer, 5, 
NULL);

// return to the original function, which is now unhooked, and modify the intended     
parameters
return MessageBoxA(NULL, "yeet", "yeet", uType);
}

void install_hook()
{
HINSTANCE hinstLib;
VOID* proxy_address;
DWORD* relative_offset;
DWORD src;
DWORD dst;
CHAR patch[5] = { 0 };
 
// 1. get memory address of the MessageBoxA function from user32.dll 
hinstLib = LoadLibrary(TEXT("user32.dll"));
hooked_address = GetProcAddress(hinstLib, "MessageBoxA");

// 2. save the first 5 bytes into saved_buffer
ReadProcessMemory(GetCurrentProcess(), hooked_address, saved_buffer, 5, NULL);

// 3. overwrite the first 5 bytes with a jump to proxy_function
proxy_address = &amp;proxy_function;
src = (DWORD)hooked_address + 5; // will jump from the next instruction (after our 5 byte         
jmp instruction)
dst = (DWORD)proxy_address;
relative_offset = (DWORD*)(dst - src);

memcpy(patch, "\xE9", 1);
memcpy(patch + 1, &amp;relative_offset, 4);

WriteProcessMemory(GetCurrentProcess(), (LPVOID)hooked_address, patch, 5, NULL);
}
 


int main()
{ 

// call without hook
MessageBoxA(NULL, "hello calling from the program", "hello", MB_OK);

install_hook();

// call with hook (arguments will be altered through the proxy function)
MessageBoxA(NULL, "we are the hook ", "hello", MB_OK);

return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>and it didnt work, the main reason why i am doing this is because i want to hook creatprocessA / W<br>
so if anyone can help in a library for that or some source code, or a guide or anything ill be so thankful, or at least what did i do wrong in the above code.<br>
i found a lot of libraries on github but it is so big, and i don’t want my executable to be that big, specially since i am trying to hook 2 or 3 functions,  and most of them are for x86 and not for x64<br>
and does the same code work if i changed it to hook createprocessw/a or createprocess</p>

          <title>QUESTION about a new idea in malware development</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[alexa]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>hiiii, this is a question in the field of malware development, i want to ask about a possibility of a technique i thought of, i want to know if it is possible or not, so if we got a loader.exe and a payload.dll, in which the payload.dll  contains the shellcode we want to execute, and the loader.exe loads this .dll file into the memory…</p>
<p>is there a way to place the loader’s code inside another legit .dll file inside windows,<br>
for example to inject the following line “PayloadDLL = LoadLibrary(L"Payload.dll”);"<br>
that is takin from the loader.exe and place it inside a function like CreateProcess();<br>
so that when CreateProcess() is called, the following line will be called too “PayloadDLL = LoadLibrary(L"Payload.dll”);"…</p>
<p>the idea here is to load my payload.dll from another .dll file, it can be something different from User32.dll or Kernel32.dll or whatever.</p>
<p>i read an article about a malware that infected a software engineering company, the malware waited for a specific function to be launched and then started executing its code, everyday it did the same…</p>
<p>i dont know that much about api hooking but i can say that i know the basics, the idea may be the same,idk, but we are not unhooking our code at the end.</p>
<p>does this idea about api functions injection work? and thank you !!!</p>

          <title>Oracle 12 Blind SQL Injection Data Exfiltration or Priv Escalation</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[farshield]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>What’s the proper technique of extracting large amounts of data on an Oracle 12 SQL Server which is accessed through a blind SQL injection from a vulnerable website with no direct access to port 1521?</p>
<p>The ideas described in this document don’t work with this version:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-10/whitepapers/Siddharth/BlackHat-USA-2010-Siddharth-Hacking-Oracle-from-the-Web-wp.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-10/whitepapers/Siddharth/BlackHat-USA-2010-Siddharth-Hacking-Oracle-from-the-Web-wp.pdf</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, server is behind a firewall and is running on a separate machine from the web server. Public IP of the server is unknown, and it’s possible that it is only accessible from the local network:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">select sys_context ('USERENV', 'SERVER_HOST'): 'database2'
select utl_inaddr.get_host_address('database2') from dual: '10.55.100.3'
</code></pre>
<p>TCP/HTTP/DNS requests from SQL queries are blocked so I’m not able to do any reverse connections.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

          <title>How to debug a com hijack</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[cherry]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi.<br>
I am trying to get this working: <a href="https://github.com/nccgroup/acCOMplice" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://github.com/nccgroup/acCOMplice</a><br>
I compiled the dll and did the com hijacking by hand (I tried the tools too but I want to understand the whole thing a bit more and they did not do the job anyways…).<br>
So as far as I understood the Code the whole thing works the following way:<br>
I look for a HKCR key which has no corresponding HKCU key. And write my own dll into the HKCU key I created (with the same CLSID). The dll i used is taken from the github page I linked above.<br>
But no matter which key I hijack the neither the key nor the COM directory (which is created by the dll code to contain the log file) show up. Since The new HKCU key seems to break the explorer.exe I am assuming that it is at least recognised by windows.<br>
My question is: Is there a way to debug (e.g. in windbg) the calls of explorer.exe to my dll? And what am I doing wrong in the process I explained above?</p>
<p>greetings</p>
