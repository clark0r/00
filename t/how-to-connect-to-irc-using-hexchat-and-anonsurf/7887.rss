    <title>How to connect to IRC using Hexchat and Anonsurf</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/how-to-connect-to-irc-using-hexchat-and-anonsurf/7887</link>
    <description>Hi all, f0rg here with another tutorial. Since most of us frequent IRC, lately some if not all the Tor exit nodes have been banned. I&#39;m not claiming that this works 100% of the time, but it should work most of the time. 

Anyways, This is my work around of their ban of Tor exit nodes because lately my current way of [&#39;How to Connect to IRC using Hexchat and Tor&#39;](https://0x00sec.org/t/how-to-connect-to-irc-using-hexchat-and-tor/6866) doesn&#39;t work 100% of the time... I&#39;ve decided to write this for those like me, who have been having trouble of connecting to IRC with Tor enabled lately because of what I stated above.

With that outta the way, lets have some fun. I don&#39;t want to go into detail what Anonsurf is, if you want to know, it&#39;s basically Tor except simplified for ParrotSec OS which is a Debian based distro running MATE as it&#39;s default Desktop Environment. Of course, thanks to github and the internet, anonsurf is available to all distros. Alright, lets begin.

In a terminal, type:

```
git clone https://github.com/parrotsec/anonsurf
```

Simple enough, I know, but we need all the scripts for this to work. Now, we must edit the torrc file. I&#39;m assuming you have Tor installed, but if not, type in a terminal:

```
sudo apt install tor
```

Now with tor installed, we must type:

```
sudo nano -w /etc/tor/torrc
```

This&#39;ll open up the torrc file with nano. Add these following lines:

```
VirtualAddrNetwork 10.192.0.0/10
AutomapHostsOnResolve 1
TransPort 9040
DNSPort 53
```

Now simply run anonsurf.sh as sudo like so:

``` 
sudo ./anonsurf.sh start
```

To stop anonsurf. Type:

``` 
sduo ./anonsurf.sh stop
```

Connect to IRC as you&#39;d normally do. 

Simple enough... of course ParrotSec OS has this by default with a nice-ish interface to work with aka buttons that&#39;ll do this without opening a terminal.

Anyways, that&#39;s enough said for now. I hope this helps those that are having issues connecting to IRC anonymously (aka tor). 

With all that being said, ~Cheers!
