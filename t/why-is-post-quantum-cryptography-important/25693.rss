    <description>Quantum  computers will break today&#39;s  asymmetric public-keys cryptography algorithms used for web encryption (https),email encryption (gnupg..),ssh and others.



Quantum computers are designed to use something  called qubits,allowing multiple states being  expressed simultaneously. This allows for breakthrough in certain  types of math problems,solving them nearly  instantaneously. Quantum computers adhere to the law  of physics,and it is only a matter of time before engineer figures out how to build  them properly .


A small 20 qubits quantum computer has already been developed  for the IBM experienced project.


Here  are some software been developed that claims to be  quantum resistant :

●  codecrypt

●  TinySSH(PQC planned)

●  Cyph

● Onetime


This is a thread  to anyone relying on encryption.
There are people out there  saving all  encrypted data and  downloading the encrypted  traffic,waiting for a way to decrypt it.

It is advised to learn the software sooner than later.</description>
