            <p>Guys, do you know about evidence of modern ransomware with the ability to not only encrypt a file, but to also target any versioning of that file as well? Im looking for the info.<br>
AWS specific would be great (s3 versioning). If WinOS specific, look for shadow copy type encryption.<br>
Thanks</p>
