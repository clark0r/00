    <title>Doubt about routing traffic</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/doubt-about-routing-traffic/7452</link>
    <description>Hello ,

recently is was reading the two diy guides of hackback

i read according to his guide he uses hacked servers to hide the ip from the stable servers

(in this case I think he was referring to the vps the name stable servers )

i was reading about pivoting but the techniques exposed using metasploit was oriented to access to the other ips of the internal network and use it too for routing traffic from a normally non-routable network.

then i was wondering how did he do that?

how blackhats/hacktivist uses a owned server to hide/mask the ip of another server ?

and how companies can protect themselves from this kind of cyber attacks (?)

thanks</description>

            <p>hi ,</p>
<p>thanks for your reply</p>
<p>this configuration is more detailed than the other</p>
<p>your knowledge help me a lot =)</p>
<p>i’ll use dante like proxy socks ( it will installed on the pwned server)</p>
<p>so the configuration is: ( i’m reviewing xd)</p>
<p>attacker vm and all traffic routed by tor using whonix gateway -&gt; connect to the vps using ssh -&gt;</p>
<p>use proxychains ( on the vps) to chain the connection to the pwned server who use the program dante -&gt; start tools using proxychains on the vps -&gt; target</p>
<p>PS: proxychains &amp; dante needed the ips of the host owned and the socks proxy chosed to connect both right?</p>
<p>thank you</p>

            <p>It is always okay to post links <strong>if they are not harmful and are educational</strong>. If you use common sense on 0x00sec, you will never be in trouble. In this case, posting these links is perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Oh yes I remember now, I had forgotten what it was called. Thanks for reminding me.</p>
<p>And I think my logic still applies. See below diagram for more clarity.</p>
<p>Attacker’s main machine -&gt; Anything in between (TOR?) -&gt; VPS -&gt; pwned hosts through proxychains -&gt; target</p>
<p>The above configuration is totally possible according to what I know, you just have to use proxychains from the VPS. Or did I not understand what you are trying to say?</p>
<p>I hope I helped once again.</p>

            <p>hello,</p>
<p>thank you so much for your reply</p>
<p>well the hacker i was talking is the same guy who hacked gamma group and hacking team ( it’s very famous)</p>
<p>i post his guide <a href="https://pastebin.com/0SNSvyjJ" rel="nofollow noopener">https://pastebin.com/0SNSvyjJ</a></p>
<p>and another doc <a href="https://pastebin.com/cRYvK4jb" rel="nofollow noopener">https://pastebin.com/cRYvK4jb</a></p>
<p>it’s very interesting i learn a lot reading this guides</p>
<p>( it’s okay if i put links?)</p>
<p>and about my doubt , first i thought he use routing or pivoting but in this case the servers are in different networks so i think it’s no possible… , if i use the configuration you’re posted the traffic goes through the owned server but i don’t have clear if the ip address of the pwned server could be used to hide other server like a vps for example ( then install the tools on the vps ) , the purpose of this configuration is protect the vps connection and be as inconspicuous as possible…</p>

            <p>My guess would be that he used these servers a proxy servers. I don’t know what this hackback guide is, but here is how I would probably do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After you have compromised a system, install a very minimalistic SOCKS proxy on it so that it won’t be easily detected</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then add the IP addresses of your pwn’d hosts to your proxychains.conf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start your tools through proxychains.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Voila! You are now sending your traffic through your pwned servers!</p>
<p>I hope my answer helped you.</p>
