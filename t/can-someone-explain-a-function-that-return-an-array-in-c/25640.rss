    <title>Can someone explain a function that return an array in c</title>

    <description>what&#39;s the * in between a return type and a function name doing when declaring a function that return an array or pointer


int * func(){


}

What&#39;s is the * doing in there or is it just conventional, I don&#39;t think so because there must be a reason it is there, I just don&#39;t want to know how to do it, I want to know why it&#39;s there.

Does it mean a function pointer, I don&#39;t think so, because a function pointer is not  declare that way.

I need an explanation, anyone.</description>

            <p>Whatever comes before the the function name is the return type, in this case it‚Äôs a <code>int *</code> ( a pointer to an int), so this function returns a pointer to an integer, or as you said an array of integers</p>
