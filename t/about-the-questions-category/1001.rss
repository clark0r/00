    <description># DISCLAIMER
Asking questions or not knowing something is not a bad thing on 0x00sec, in fact its something very critical to learning. However, **asking in the correct way is very important**. Posts like &quot;Plz help me hax my sk00l pls&quot; are considered spammy, and will be **aggresively** deleted. Please realise that nobody here owes you anything, it is up to you to gain respect and ask correctly. You do not deserve help, however people here are happy to help. 

We understand that English may not be your main language, but please refrain from using slang, mispelling (within reason), and placing newlines in weird places. If you would like an example of spammy posts, just look through this [page](http://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/forum/). 

Clearly space out your text and mention your problem, what you&#39;re using, what you have tried, and clearly what your question is.</description>
