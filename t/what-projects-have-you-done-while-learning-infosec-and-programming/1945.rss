    <title>What projects have you done while learning InfoSec and programming?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/what-projects-have-you-done-while-learning-infosec-and-programming/1945</link>
    <description>As you all know, one of the most efficient ways of learning programming/InfoSec is by creating your own programs, hacking tools etc. But it can be frustrating at times to find a good project to work on. In order to solve this problem and give the members of this beautiful community the chance to demonstrate the cool things they made, I came up with with the following idea.

Why don&#39;t you folks tell us about some cool projects you have worked on while learning InfoSec and programming? It doesn&#39;t have to be complete projects. Projects/ideas of various skill levels/fields would be nice to be shared so that most of the members can get inspired by them despite their current knowledge.

Thanks in advance.</description>

            <p>I’ve been working on a project called <a href="https://git.0x00sec.org/pry0cc/GitSlap">GitSlap</a>, basically a recon tool for scanning github user commits for emails.</p>
<p>And, as I always bang on about, <a href="https://git.0x00sec.org/JSchmoe/unnamed-shell/">STELF</a>. A really cool shell in Python.</p>
<p>I would be interested in starting a malware project for Linux. Something really quiet and stealthy that you could load into a server given that you have some sort of shell access. Especially something like the guys used in the <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/flexispy-hack-write-up/1926/">Flexispy hack</a>.</p>
<p>Malware for users and clients is quite common, but malware made for servers is pretty rare (in my experience).</p>

            <p>I make all sorts of improvised weapons to introduce “the militarized hacker”, which is basically a hacker that has a more aggressive &amp; direct approach (like in Watch Dogs/Watch Dogs 2). This goes from long-lasting molotov cocktails, to plastic explosives to breach walls &amp; smoke bombs for distraction, to hidden blades &amp; electronic weapons like tasers and EMP’s.</p>
<p>The only ones that are successful are my molotov cocktail, smoke bombs, EMP, and the taser.</p>
<p>Yo what did you expect? They say hackers are the warriors of the future, it’s time to act like one too <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Hi Kage,<br>
Nice idea! But somehow, I found the title a bit misleading(makes me think of a list of current 0x00sec gitpab collabs). Maybe “What projects have you done while learning cybersec?” or something like that would be more appropiate <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
