    <title>Time to part ways!</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/time-to-part-ways/1491</link>
    <description>It is said that once in a while a person has to reinvent himself (I follow Zen philosophy). I believe it&#39;s my time to answer myself to the questions I&#39;ve been pondering upon for quite some time now. So I&#39;ve decided to go on a break, facing the uncertainty of life to refuel the mind. 

Home is not a place but a feeling and I feel home in here seeing all these lovely enthusiasts. I couldn&#39;t contribute much but I wish this place will grow into something majestic and a harbor to everyone who seek knowledge. 

&quot;Parting is such sweet sorrow that I shall say goodnight till it be morrow.&quot;

Regards,
