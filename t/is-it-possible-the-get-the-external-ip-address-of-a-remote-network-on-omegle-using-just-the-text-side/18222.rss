    <title>Is it possible the get the external IP address of a remote network on omegle using just the text side?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/is-it-possible-the-get-the-external-ip-address-of-a-remote-network-on-omegle-using-just-the-text-side/18222</link>
    <description>Wondering if its possible to get the external address of someone using the chat side of omegle. The video side works using UDP, but it looks like the text side is relayed through a bunch of relays which means I am probably out of luck... I understand posting a URL that redirects to capture it in the chat window could grab the info theoretically.

Any thoughts?</description>

            <p>I’d say just send them an IP logger. I like <a href="https://iplogger.org" rel="nofollow noopener">https://iplogger.org</a> and grabify. <a href="http://iplogger.org" rel="nofollow noopener">iplogger.org</a> will let you pick your filename extension, so you could make it a picture file ext.</p>
