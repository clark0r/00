    <title>Share Your Android Device&#39;s Internet Connection</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/share-your-android-devices-internet-connection/866</link>
    <description>**Intro**
Hey guys, this post (as you can see from the title) is about how to use your Android device as a wireless adapter! It&#39;s a really simple trick, although I&#39;m sure you guys might like it. Having said that lets get right into it! :smile:
***
**Just a Bit of Backstory**
So why would you need something like this? Well very recently I came upon the misfortune of having the only device that I have that currently ran Linux breaking- almost leaving me without a device to run Linux for around a year. Now I could have used an old laptop I had which ran windows and ran Linux on a VM but considering the laptop only had 1 gig of RAM and 2 gigs of space left, I don&#39;t think it would have worked out. However when browsing a thrift shop I amazingly found a dell desktop with 2 gigs of RAM and 32 gigs of free space for only $20. When I had the chance to open it I saw it had Windows Vista- and Windows being Windows as usual it had a serious Malware problem. Since I was going to get Linux on it anyways I quickly installed Lubuntu on it with a usb drive, until I noticed that the desktop came without a wifi card. After some quick research I realized you could use an Android device as a wireless adapter.
***
**What You&#39;ll Need**


*   An Android Device (Not sure which version you could use, although if you have an old version it is possible to switch to a newer version)

*  A Micro USB cable

***
**What You&#39;ll Need To Do**
Alright so connect your Android Device to a computer by using the USB Cable. Then head into your settings and enable USB tethering. After doing so what I did was also enable Bluetooth tethering which shared my device&#39;s internet connection.
***
**Conclusion**
Well guys that&#39;s it! Just to clear a few things up this trick will work with most computers. If your device has a data connection you can also just make a portable hotspot without the need for something like a cable (although your computer would also have to be able to connect to the hotspot), however my device (a nexus 7 tablet) is Wi-Fi only meaning that in that case you would have needed a cable.  Anyways thanks for reading! Hope the trick helps!</description>

            <p>I heard it takes a horrible amount of effort and even then some apps don’t recognize the connection.</p>
