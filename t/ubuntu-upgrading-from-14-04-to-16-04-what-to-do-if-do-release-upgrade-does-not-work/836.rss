    <title>Ubuntu: upgrading from 14.04 to 16.04, what to do if do-release-upgrade does not work</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/ubuntu-upgrading-from-14-04-to-16-04-what-to-do-if-do-release-upgrade-does-not-work/836</link>
    <description>Recently I&#39;ve tried to upgrade Ubuntu from version 14.04 to 16.04 and discovered that for some reason `sudo do-release-upgrade -d` doesn&#39;t work as expected:

```text
eax@fujitsu:~$ sudo do-release-upgrade -d
Checking for a new Ubuntu release
No new release found
```

There is little information about this issue in the Internet so I think this howto can really help someone.

First of all, go to System Settings -&gt; Software &amp; Updates -&gt; Updates, make sure `trusty-security` and `trusty-updates` checkboxes are selected. Run:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -V
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -V
sudo reboot
```

After reboot make sure your Ubuntu version is 14.04.4 now:

```text
eax@fujitsu:/etc/apt$ cat /etc/lsb-release 
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=&quot;Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS&quot;
eax@fujitsu:/etc/apt$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS
Release:	14.04
Codename:	trusty
```

Now edit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades:

```text
eax@fujitsu:~$ cat /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades
# Default behavior for the release upgrader.

[DEFAULT]
# ...
Prompt=lts # &lt;--- CHECK THIS LINE!
```

After all this `sudo do-release-upgrade -d` should upgrade your system to 16.04.1 or newer.

_Supplemental:_ Common issue after updating to 16.04 is a re-enabled guest login. To disable it just execute this command:

```bash
sudo sh -c &#39;printf &quot;[SeatDefaults]\nallow-guest=false\n&quot; &gt; /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-no-guest.conf&#39;

            <p>This helped me as well. I tried the usual commands of do-release-upgrade with the -d and -c flags. None of that worked except what you showed here. Thank you!</p>
