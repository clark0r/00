    <title>How to perform action upon connection to netcat listener?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/how-to-perform-action-upon-connection-to-netcat-listener/3382</link>
    <description>The subject pretty much says it all. I&#39;m searching for a method to perform some actions on my linux machine upon connection to a netcat listener, such as sending an e-mail/sms notification.

The best I&#39;ve been able to come up with would be setup some pipes as the input/output to the listener, and have a shell script running which monitors those pipes, but I was hoping the linux guru&#39;s here might have something a bit more elegant.</description>

            <p>As <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/lantern-shadowclaw">@lantern-shadowclaw</a> pointed out, you can use pipes, otherwise, if netcat is not a strict requirement, you can use socket units with systemd, listening on a port of choice and activating a service for each connection (or event).</p>
<p>Here’s the recipe: <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.socket.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.socket.html</a></p>

            <p>Piping is your best bet but I don’t what you would want to pipe</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nc -l -u 2222 | tee vidrx.mp4 | mplayer -fps 70 -vf-add flip -demuxer<br>
h264es -</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a command I use at work to stream a video signal from a rpi robot. Hope this helps.</p>
