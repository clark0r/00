    <title>I&#39;m curious if anyone would be willing to share their insights on a PHP vulnerability scanner?</title>

    <description>We previously shared [a post](https://0x00sec.org/t/i-was-wondering-if-anyone-would-like-to-give-their-thoughts-on-a-php-vulnerability-scanner/37932) and wanted to inform you that we&#39;ve added a cool new feature to the scanner.

Great news! You asked - we delivered! When we first started, scanning your project required you  to click the Scan button and upload your code. You could package your project and upload it as one archive file, or upload up to 15 individual PHP files. 

Our users asked us to add integrations with GitHub and GitLab to allow automated secure code checks to your CI/CD pipeline. Voila - now you can connect PHP Secure to your repository and run automated scans directly in your workflow!

Adding secure code checks to your existing workflow is easy. We have included all the step-by-step instructions to make it simple. Just follow the instructions carefully to set it up without a hitch.

Once connected, every time it is deployed, PHP Secure will check your project for vulnerabilities. Whenever new vulnerabilities are found, you&#39;ll be notified. You can view your scan results in your PHP Secure account.

Keep your applications secure and prevent deployment of vulnerable applications or components (registries) by adding PHP Secure to the build as a step in the pipeline.

What do you think of this new feature?

We strive to be on the cutting edge and offer you a superior product for years to come! Do you have any suggestions for improvement?</description>
