    <description>Hi - I&#39;m looking for a TG channel where they used to upload current aggressor scripts for Cobalt.  Does anyone know what is is called?  I believe (was awhile ago) there was some Chinese characters in the title.

Looking for some more recent Privilege Escalation options for Cobalt and this TG group seemed to stay current.</description>

            <p>I’m curious, as well.  I’ve written Aggressor scripts in the past and it’s not terribly difficult to port a given exploit/technique to the aggressor language. There are a ton of OLD aggressor scripts in various Github repos out there, but I’m eager to learn about up-to-date ones.</p>
