    <title>HackTheBox Weekly Challenge - Lightweight</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/hackthebox-weekly-challenge-lightweight/12552</link>
    <description>Hi 0x00ers! 

On this week of grinding away to further improve our skills and flex our hacking muscles, we will all be working on this box.

Hopefully, as the weeks go on, we will all progress and learn new things as a group and in several years of working and training, we&#39;ll be tackling the very hard boxes with ease.

This is a fun Linux box, the user was quite cool and required a bit of creativity, the root was awesome and very new to me. This is part of what I love about these boxes, each time you&#39;ll learn a new technique or reinforce others.

            <p>Although slightly off topic, I want to let you know that I think it’s pretty cool how you handle this forum in general but also like in this case. The way you write it sounds like rather a team leader (who approaches his team on eye-level) than some anonymous forum admin. Pretty nice! You’re doing a very good job, <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a></p>
