    <title>Stream the desktop with python</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/stream-the-desktop-with-python/6436</link>
    <description>Hello guys it&#39;s my first post here :)
First it&#39;s great for me to be part of this community because you are really great people .
Second i have finished a reverse shell in python and i have added a lot of features but the only thing i couldn&#39;t add was stream the desktop like vnc in metasploit . 
So my question is it&#39;s possible to make it with python ? 
And if the answer is yes how can i do that ? 
Thanks anyway :D</description>
