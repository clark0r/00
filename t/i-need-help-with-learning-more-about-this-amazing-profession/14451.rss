    <description>Hey Guys! I don&#39;t know if this is the right place to post this question so I will apologize in advance. So I discovered this site as it was recommended to me by a friend. I have been learning cybersecurity for about 2 months now, which basically means I&#39;m a complete script kiddie. but I have a very strong interest in cybersecurity, infosec and in particular penetration testing. I&#39;ve been watching youtube videos and writeup blogs but I&#39;m looking to expand my knowledge faster and maybe via a more reputable source. So basically I&#39;m writing this to ask if anyone who be kind enough to direct me to some free courses or tutorials that I could learn from or point me into the right direction of were I should continue to learn and gain more information about pentesting. By what I have seen this community is great and I&#39;m so glad I found this site!
Thank you all so much!</description>

            <p>Actually there is a really good book written by <span class="mention">@ZephrFish</span> called “Breaking Into Information Security: Learning the ropes 101”. I’d really recommend giving him a shout and seeing if you can get a copy of it. If you’re going to Steelcon (UK) next month then try and grab a copy off him <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It’s a solid book for beginners!</p>

            <p>There are loads of resources to learn from, I can recommend a few books if you want to read them. Most of the books by NoStarchPress are pretty good and they are on humble bundle sometimes too.</p>
<p>Courses: udemy, skillshare, pentesterlabs<br>
Practical: HackTheBox, PentesterLabs, <a href="http://WebSec.fr" rel="nofollow noopener">WebSec.fr</a><br>
Books: NoStarchPress books, Web Application Hackers Handbook (v2), The Tangled Web, etc</p>
