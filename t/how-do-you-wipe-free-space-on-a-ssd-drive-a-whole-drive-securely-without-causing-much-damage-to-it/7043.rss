    <title>How do you wipe free space on a SSD drive/a whole drive securely without causing much damage to it?</title>

    <description>Hey peeps,

as I was sweeping thru a bunch of drives with the purpose of saving data for 3rd party I started to wonder what is the best way to keep the bytes in order on HDDs with security in mind. Most of these drives are SSDs so the typical let&#39;s write a bunch of data to the drive over and over again is not the best way because it may wear the SSD out quickly. If i wasn&#39;t worrying about the state of drives I&#39;d normally go down that way, but I&#39;d like to find a more balanced solution.

In the days I&#39;ll be focused on this subject since I just reflected on how uneducated I&#39;m in the topic, and basically in (anti)forensics. When I gather enough data I may come back with my results. Meanwhile I&#39;m open for suggestions.

Question summarized:
_**How do you wipe free space on a SSD drive/a whole drive securely without causing much damage to it?**_

Bonus question:
_**What encryption method works best for you ?**_
*I&#39;m using BitLocker on Win, FileVault on Mac for ease of use and integrity, and VeraCrypt for my external drives*

p.s. I couldn&#39;t find an appropriate topic for the thread, please put it in the right one.</description>

            <p>Wiping free space(which would securely prevent recovery) would damage the drive. I am not sure how bleachbit would work in this situation.</p>

            <p>I use bleachbit. If you’re asking about a Linux version of defrago or something then you probaly want to use gparted or something.</p>
