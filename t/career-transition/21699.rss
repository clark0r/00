    <title>Career Transition</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/career-transition/21699</link>
    <description>Has anyone here made a transition from a different role in infosec into pentesting or red team work?

I currently do security systems engineering (I help build COTS/FOSS tools/SOC apparatus) and am working towards my OSCP in my limited spare time. I have an interest in giving the offensive side a shot after I can pass the OSCP exam, but I would be going from a relatively lucrative position to a complete know-nothing noob. I&#39;ve learned that I do better when I work with a team of people that I can speak to and bounce questions off of. However, I don&#39;t have any idea how I would get my foot in the door even if I were able to find an entry point without taking too much of a salary cut. It kind of seems that I&#39;m possibly at the point in my career where I&#39;m better off just doing CTFs for fun.

I&#39;d appreciate any guidance you may have in how to approach this.</description>

<p>I used to hack around randomly on the internet without knowing what I am doing  when I was a kid. Sooner I found linux, tinkered a lot, installed many distros. But then, I needed money so I hosted two websites and went for an interview for a web developer. Sooner became a backend developer. I was at peak and was expected to work on a project that would have been a micro service. The architecture client had asked for was quite impressive. Completing that project would have given my career a big boost as  its quite a big thing indeed. Now lockdown in my country due to COVID-19 has forced me to leave the job. Now that I have some time, I am thinking about becoming a penetration tester. Right now I am trying to catch up with the industry and possibly do some bug bounty hunting to fill up the blank CV.</p>
