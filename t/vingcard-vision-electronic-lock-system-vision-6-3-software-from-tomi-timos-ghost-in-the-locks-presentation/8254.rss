    <title>VingCard Vision electronic lock system - Vision 6.3 software from Tomi &amp; Timo&#39;s &#39;Ghost in the Locks&#39; presentation?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/vingcard-vision-electronic-lock-system-vision-6-3-software-from-tomi-timos-ghost-in-the-locks-presentation/8254</link>
    <description>It was recently discovered this year by Tomi Tuominen &amp; Timo Hirvonen ([as shown in their presentation, &#39;Ghost in the Locks&#39; at the Infiltration 2018 conference](https://downloads.immunityinc.com/infiltrate2018-slidepacks/tomi-tuominen-timo-hirvonen-ghost-in-the-locks/2018-04-27-ghost-in-the-locks--infiltrate-2018-edition.pdf)) how to to open VingCard locks without access to the original key. 

Additionally, Slawomir Jasek elaborated further on this research in his presentation at CONFidence Conference ([titled &quot;A 2018 Practical Guide to Hacking NFC/RFID&quot;](https://smartlockpicking.com/slides/Confidence_A_2018_Practical_Guide_To_Hacking_RFID_NFC.pdf)) that it is possible to brute-force any given hotel guest card in order to create a master keycard.

&quot;VingCard Vision&quot; is the software used by various hotel chains for the VingCard electronic lock system for encoding access cards. -- Slawomir Jasek had a screenshot in his presentation, as did Tomi Tuominen &amp; Timo Hirvonen, showing that they located + downloaded the &quot;Vision 6.3 Total CD.zip&quot; of the VingCard software itself from a site ending in /webdownloads/Vision_  . I managed to do some Google-Fu and locate what I believe was the download site they accessed: [http://www.sectron.com/webdownloads/Vision_](http://www.sectron.com/webdownloads/Vision_)   (note the trailing underscore at the end).  Also, the Sectron forum post that explicitly shows this link having directed to a download at one point is located here: [http://forum.sectron.com/index.php?topic=7903.msg11381#msg11381](http://forum.sectron.com/index.php?topic=7903.msg11381#msg11381)

Unfortunately, the link doesn&#39;t seem to be working anymore to download the software, and it wasn&#39;t backed up on Wayback Machine prior to becoming unaccessible.

I was curious; did anyone happen to snag a copy of it before it became unavailable? :confused: It would have been such an interesting piece of software to attempt reverse-engineering.</description>
