    <description>For those of you following Legobot&#39;s progress, here&#39;s a quick update:

Version 1.1.3 was released today. See changelog below.

https://github.com/Legobot/Legobot/blob/develop/CHANGES.md

@Nitrax and @zSec have jumped in and been a tremendous help lately. We&#39;ve pushed through a few bugs, tightened up the core a bit, and the guys have started work on expanding my nmap lego into a full-blown net-tools package.

@pry0cc and friends have started a great discussion in an issue on the repo about how to even do chatops for attackers while @sprtn has provided good insight into how current tools work, what would be valuable to integrate, and how he does his work.

Roadmap (in no particular order):

 - Discord integration
 - Get to 0.1.0 on the [nettools plugin](https://github.com/Legobot/legos.nettools)
 - Brainstorm on additional offensive plugins, perhaps with things like sqlmap
 - Improve documentation and get docs hosted on ReadTheDocs
 - Build multi-protocol chat bridge

If you have ides or want to help, let me know!</description>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/ricksanchez">@ricksanchez</a> I’m not a coder as well, but this is the reason why I started learning python. And already with 1 hour of python experience I was able to write a module.</p>
<p>Of course I couldn’t do it without the help of our extremely talented people like <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/fraq">@fraq</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/nitrax">@Nitrax</a> (thanks again guys!), but I bet you will be able to create something awesome as well.</p>
<p>Just try it, you only can learn from this and this is a really terrific project! <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I just got little notice about this project during my absence the last few days. Awesome stuff!<br>
Good job @ all the involved !</p>
<p>I’m in with what <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a> says.<br>
If we just take the Intrusion kill chain as an example:  Recon comes first. Always.<br>
Weaponize is second <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’d love to help but I ain’t much of a coder <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I would suggest that a module capable of detecting web apps and their versions could be priceless. Something that is very basic to do from a human standpoint, but is fairly difficult to automate.</p>
<p>Being able to detect web apps and versions, you could automatically load up exploits for unpatched versions of the software. Passive shodan scans are possible as well.</p>
<p>I think it would be good to focus mostly on recon. Once we have a solid recon platform in chatops, we can move onto the next steps.</p>
