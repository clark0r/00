    <title>Crypters - Some questions</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/crypters-some-questions/29335</link>
    <description>Recently, I&#39;ve taken an interest in writing my own crypter.. It&#39;s been very hard due to the lack of &quot;good tutorials.&quot; I would ask you to post sources of materials or courses for us to study.

What i notice is that the crypters only work for some time... So my question is, why?
if the contents are encrypted, how antivirus are able to catch them?
My guess is some sort of sandboxing analysis or heuristics that catch them... but since the code is run in memory, can we really evade AVs? 

Thanks for any answers. Im kinda new in the malware programming..</description>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/oiashdhf">@oiashdhf</a></p>
<p>Actually there is a part that is not encrypted, otherwise the program cannot run. This is usually named <em>stub</em> and AV can either just add a signature that matches that <em>stub</em> as well as analyse the use of certain system calls that are required in order to be able to decrypt and run the <code>.text</code> segment. Furthermore, some techniques to run the decrypted code (to give control back to the original program) are commonly used by virus and therefore are well-known to AV SW.</p>
<p>You can take a look to:</p>

    This is the first instalment to dive you deep into the awesome world of crypters. You will learn everything about these little guys which are a usual component of different types of malware, including the RATs that we are discussing right now. 
Technically, crypters, in their traditional form, are closer related to virus, than to any other malware, in the sense that they require in deep knowledge of the binary format of the target system (ELF, PE,…), but this looks like a good time to start digg…

    In the previous instalment we manage to find the relevant parts of the binary to crypt and actually crypt them. Now we need to inject our stub code and modify the binary to execute it before anything else. This gonna be fun.

Instead of going with the full stub I will first introduce a very simple one so we can focus on the code injection concept. Why?. Well, this is how I actually did it. The real stuff is a relatively complex program that will have its own bugs, so we better use a…

    Finally we are going to get our crypter complete and operational. We have already covered the main technical areas involving ohow ton crypt binaries and now we just need to commit. We already have a complete crypter able to crypt the relevant parts of the code and inject our stub using different techniques. We are only missing the final version of our stub. 
In this last instalment we are going to put together all the elements to get our stub complete.

<p>To check the basics: What is that <em>stub</em> about? or what syscalls are required and why? These posts are GNU/Linux oriented but the concepts are the same for all OSes… You just have to use different syscalls and deal with different file formats.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>It’s going to take some knowledge of programming. If you want to PM me what you’ve been trying along with the source code of what you’re trying to crypt, I can try to assist. Essentially you just need to not make it so obvious for AV’s. This includes not using known libraries that might be flagged (go look at the what the library is calling and use that instead), encode the original source code several times along with some sort of way to unpack it (maybe even making the unpacking part a separate stage all together so the packed version and unpacking rules don’t get put in the same file), change variable names around to be something that looks like it’s doing something else, etc. I wouldn’t say that I’m extremely experienced in this, but I have been able to take a few well-known viruses and making them FUD just by playing around with the original source code a bit.</p>

            <p>why?antivirus are able to catch them well it’s sample because it’s get scan by various AV companies and that make the crypter UD, many crypter authors will provide frequent updates to the crypter software, in the form of stub files. These contain the latest methods or algorithms used to augment the malware passed through to it, in an attempt to stay ahead of Anti-Virus companies detecting their methods, for example <a href="http://virustotal.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">virustotal.com</a> will send every file you scan to AV companies, if you want to  stay (FUD) for long time, then you will need an AV scanner that not distribute the samples.</p>
