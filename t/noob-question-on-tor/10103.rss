    <title>Noob question on TOR</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/noob-question-on-tor/10103</link>
    <description>I always have associated Tor with Http/Https requests and responses.  Is there a way  to take advantage of Tor for none web based activity?  For example If I want to use a tool such as nmap or some other socket tool, can you still use Tor?

I am looking at ways to improve my anonymity.  I hear that using both Tor and VPN is one way of doing so.
But I want to be able to perform other activities than web based interrogations?

Reading the Tor site just references the use of the Tor Browser.

Thanks

            <p>Tor is a socks proxy.</p>
<p>So it lets you tunnel all kinds of traffic (except ICMP), over tor.</p>
<p>You can nmap, metasploit, gobuster, or any number of things by using proxychains.</p>
