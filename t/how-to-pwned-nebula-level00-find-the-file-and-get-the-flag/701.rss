Hello Hackers and welcome to the ***How to pwned Nebula Guide***

Before you read this &quot;How to&quot;, please try the challenge on your own and use this &quot;guide&quot; only if you&#39;re stuck ! :)
I hope you are ready to go !


## Level00 - find the file and get the flag
---
Here is the first level of Nebula :

&gt;This level requires you to find a Set User ID program that will run as the “flag00” account. You could also find this by carefully looking in top level directories in / for suspicious looking directories.

&gt;Alternatively, look at the find man page.

We should find a Set User Id program that will run as the &quot;flag00&quot; account. 

So here the important part 

A **SUID file** that run as **flag00**

What we want is a file owned by flag00 and with the SUID bit set 

The permission of the file we want should look like that 

 -rwsr-x---

The important thing to notice is the *s* it means the file can be executed as the owner

to find the correct file just user the find command : 
```bash
 find / -perm -4000 -user flag00 2&gt;/dev/null
```

run one of those to get the flag !
