    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/hello-everyone-i-have-encountered-some-difficulties/10505</link>
    <description>Dear everyone.
    I come from China.I am a university student.What a good afternoon，but I am worried about my study in the dormitory.My school grades are no problem. I am mainly worried about my future employment problems.My school is not an excellent school, and the curriculum is chaotic. I only listen to the teacher every day，but my teacher can only teach us by PPT .I want to change my life now. I am very interested in information security. I have been a script kid for a few years.Now I want to master some technical things such as software reversal and anti-virus knowledge.I,have many problems ,and my teacher can`t help me.I hope someone can help me.
How to start learning about software reversal?Where should I start?Assembly language is a tough bone. How much do I need to learn?If you can tell me, thank you very much.</description>
