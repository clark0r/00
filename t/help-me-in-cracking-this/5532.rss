    <title>Help me in cracking this</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/help-me-in-cracking-this/5532</link>
    <description>Hello. I need some help :D 

I am supposed to crack the authentication algorithm used in SIM cards - called comp128 V2 . It is used in authenticating your sim with the network using SIM secret key ( and getting this key is my target :D ). V1 of this algorithm was cracked long ago (before 2002) but it is useless now in 2018 :D 
I have no previous experience in cryptanlysis( But for sure I have in programming :D ) but I was to do it my self as I FOUND NO ATTACK ON THIS VERSION AS NO ONE CARES NOW ABOUT 2G :(

My questions that I hope to get answers.
1- The only thing I had is a good understand of the code, What should I do next to break it ? (some advises may help )

2- Does anyone know on dark/deep web any forums,websites,blogs,...etc which may help in this? ( hacking but on communications systems(2G,..etc), IMSI catchers and hardware not normal exploits,..etc stuff.)  and can if they need invitation someone give me one :D 

Code ( if any one cares about it ):
