    <title>[Feature] Allow non-staff to give themselves a custom title</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/feature-allow-non-staff-to-give-themselves-a-custom-title/834</link>
    <description>A pretty simple thing, but it hasn&#39;t been suggested yet for some reason. If it is possible, users who have reached a certain trust level (I recommend the &quot;member&quot; trust level) should have the ability to change the title displayed behind their names by themselves, and not have a mod do it for them. I think this would save the moderators &amp; admins a lot of time and would be a lot more convenient for members. Let me know below what you think!

[poll]
- Yes, that would be awesome!
- No thanks! I don&#39;t mind asking admins.

            <p>Okay! All Done, now just remove your title, and set your full name name to your “title”.</p>

            <p>It’s possible to write plugins, although, theres more to just knowing ruby needed. It is all publicly documented however. If anybody wants to have a go at writing a plugin, go for it!</p>

<p>Hey, we are hackers after all! Lets write some code in Ruby, patch Discourse a little bit and it’s done <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Just kidding. I don’t think anyone here would waste his or her time on this.</p>

            <p>We can make his happen. However the only potential way (as of now) is using Full Names as titles, so full names will be displayed next to the username, rather than the title. Full names <strong>are</strong> user editable.</p>
