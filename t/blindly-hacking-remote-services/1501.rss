    <title>Blindly Hacking Remote Services</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/blindly-hacking-remote-services/1501</link>
    <description>Continuing the discussion from [Remote Exploit. Shellcode without Sockets](https://0x00sec.org/t/remote-exploit-shellcode-without-sockets/1440/12):

No this is not a log post on how to hack remote services. By chance I found an interesting paper that presents an interesting technique to hack your way into a remote server without having a local binary.

This is the link

http://www.scs.stanford.edu/brop/bittau-brop.pdf

The technique is very noisy (you will be crashing the server again and again) but I have found it very interesting. As usually this does not work on any service out there. There are some constraints on the service in order to apply this technique... but I believe it is an interesting reading.

The technique allows to bypass ASLR, Stack Canaries and no executable stacks... under some circumstances...

Haven&#39;t tried myself yet...</description>
