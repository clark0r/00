    <description>Hi again genius 

I&#39;m going to setup a pentesting lab so I can practice just wanted to get a few views of how you guys do things.

Was going to use kali as base OS then use some sort of vm 

I&#39;ll update this soon and let you guys know what I&#39;ve done I&#39;ll start sitting up things in a couple of hours

If I have posted in the wrong place admin please move apologies</description>

            <p>Thanks guys<br>
I’m still researching so I understand the vm and the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Think I will start with vm box</p>
<p>Not focusing on kali but it was the chosen one when I thought that I was some cracker just because I installed a linux OS funny thing was I did not have a clue how to use the dam thing coming from windows.<br>
Now look I love the dam thing dont really need the graphical interface love command line</p>
<p>I will take a look at your suggestions and update how I’m getting on.</p>
<p>But if any one has a little spare keyboard time explain a little differences in labs depending on what one is doing.</p>
<p>Nice one</p>

            <p>The setup very much depends on resources you have available for the lab and what you want to practice. A great starting point is to read few posts on <a href="https://0x00sec.org/search?q=lab">this forum</a> to give you an idea how people setup and use their labs for particular purpose. <a href="https://kb.help.rapid7.com/docs/setting-up-a-penetration-testing-lab" rel="nofollow noopener">Rapid7</a> also has high level recommendations for box specs you may want to consider while building your own lab with Metasploit for example.

            <p>Kali doesn’t matter, it’s just Debian with extra fluff.<br>
Focus on what kind of targets and attack scenarios you want to simulate in your lab.</p>
