    <title>Writing CTF Challenges</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/writing-ctf-challenges/17249</link>
    <description>Hi everyone!

I&#39;d like to create some CTF challenges for my local meetups but unsure how to actually write intentionally vulnerable code.  Does anyone have a framework or resources for creating CTFs?  I could write a basic buffer overflow or an open string compare program but would like variety.  

Another goal of these is to demonstrate what a CTF is to people new to our field.  In the future, this could be built into a &quot;CTF writing guide&quot; if there isn&#39;t one already.  Any help is appreciated!</description>
