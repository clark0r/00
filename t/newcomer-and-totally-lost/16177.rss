    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/newcomer-and-totally-lost/16177</link>
    <description>I am a new student of networks, and i am very interested in cybersecurity, but i am quite lost, i feel quite overwhelmed in the sense that i feel that i lack much base knowledge, how networks, and operating systems works.
Any tips of good books to cover my bases, i have TCP/IP illustred and networks a top down aproach in my backlog, but i really dont know any good books to help me truly understand how the OS and kernel work and how to exploit it.</description>
