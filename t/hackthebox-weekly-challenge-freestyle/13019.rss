    <title>HackTheBox Weekly Challenge - Freestyle</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/hackthebox-weekly-challenge-freestyle/13019</link>
    <description>Hi 0x00ers! 

This weekly HackTheBox challenge is a bit of an unusual one. In the #hackthebox channel on the VIP Discord Server, I noticed a lot of us had gotten behind on existing weekly challenges due to life and other things, so we&#39;re all in different places.

Also, looking at the current boxes that are available, it seems that I have owned most of the easy-medium rated boxes, and I got really bored on last weeks Box, LaCasaDePapal and gave up, but might have a crack at it again.
