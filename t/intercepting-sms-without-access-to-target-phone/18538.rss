    <title>Intercepting SMS Without Access to Target Phone?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/intercepting-sms-without-access-to-target-phone/18538</link>
    <description>Intercepting SMS without physical access to the device. I see posts claiming both that it *is possible*, and also that its *impossible*. The thing is, both sides try to sell me something. If it works, I don&#39;t mind paying for it. Just don&#39;t want to waste money on a scam.

Is there a way to intercept SMS this way? Doesn&#39;t have to be easy, just looking for a possibility.

Thanks</description>

            <p>Yes, you have to have a fake cell phone tower most known as IMSI-Catcher or a portable cellphone tower (most known as FemtoCell or MicroCell) (refer to the chosen vendor webpage for more information, they vary from ~$300 to ~$1000 irc).</p>
