----------

## (&gt;Introduction&lt;)

What is a BLACK BOX? A BLACK BOX is a device that is hooked up to your phone that fixes your phone so that when you get a call, the caller doesn&#39;t get charged for the call. This is good for calls up to 1/2 hour, after 1/2  hour the Gestapo comes (you can guess what happens)
 
What this little beauty does is keep the line voltage from dropping  to 10v when you answer your phone. The line is instead kept at 36v and it will make the phone think that it is still ringing while your talking. The reason for the 1/2 hour time limit is that the Gestapo thinks that something is wrong after 1/2 an hour of ringing. (I mean, come on)

##   (&gt;Phone Modification Instructions&lt;)

All parts are available  Radio Shack. Using the least possible parts and arrangement, the cost is $0.98; and that is parts for two  of them! Talk  about a deal! If you  want  to splurge then you can get a board, and a switch.
 
 
                      **  Schematic 1 for most fones  **

                      **         LED ON: BOX ON       **
 
                    FROM &gt;--------------------GREEN-&gt;  TO
                    LINE &gt;--!   1.8k  LED  !---RED--&gt; FONE
                            !--/\/\/\--!&gt;--!
                            !              !
                            ------&gt;/&lt;-------
                                 SPST
 
 
 
    Parts:  1 1.8k 1/2 watt resistor
            1 1.5v LED
            1 SPST switch
 
   *You may just have two wires which you connect together for the switch.
 
 
                       **  Schematic 2 for all fones  **
                       **        LED ON: BOX OFF      **
                     FROM &gt;---------------GREEN-&gt;  TO
                     LINE &gt;-------      ---RED--&gt; FONE
                                 !  LED !
                               ----&gt;/&lt;--!&gt;--
                               !         !
                               ---/\/\/---
                                  1.8k
 
    Parts:  1 1.8k 1/2 watt resistor
            1 1.5v LED
            1 DPST switch
 
 
  Here is the PC board layout that I recommend using. It is neat and is very easy to hook up:
 
                      Schematic #1        Schematic #2
 
                     **************     ****************
                     *            *     *  -------     *
                     * --&lt;LED&gt;--- *     *  !     !     *
                     * !        ! *     *  ! &lt;SWITCH&gt;  *
                     * RESISTOR ! *     *  ! !      !  *
                     *        ! ! *     *  ! !      /  *
                     * -------- ! *     *  ! !      \  *
                     * !        ! *     *  ! &lt;LED&gt;! /  *
                     * --SWITCH-- *     *  !      ! \  *
                     *  !      !  *     *  !      ! /  *
                   L *  !      !  * F L *  !      ! !  * F
                   I&gt;RED-      -RED&gt;O I&gt;RED-      ---RED&gt;O
                   N&gt;-----GREEN----&gt;N N&gt;-----GREEN------&gt;N
                   E * h          * E E *              * E
                     **************     ****************
 
 
 Once you have hooked up all the parts, you must figure out what set of wires go to the line and which go to the fone. This is because of the fact that LED&#39;s must be put in, in a certain direction.  Depending on which way you put the LED is what controls what wires are for the line &amp; fone. In order to find out, hook up the box in one direction using one set of wires for line and the other for phone.
 
**NOTE**  For Model I switch should be OFF.
**NOTE**  For Model ][ switch  should  be set to side connecting the LED.

Once you have hooked it up, then pick up the fone and see if the LED  is on.  If it is, the LED will be lit.  If is  doesn&#39;t light then switch the wires and try again. Once you know which are which  then label them.  NOTE: If neither directions worked then your switch was in the wrong position. Now label the switch in its current position as BOX ON.

##   (&gt;Black Box Usage&lt;)

The purpose of this box is not  to people  who  call you so it would make sense  that  it  can only  be  used  to receive calls.   When the box is  *ON* then you may only receive calls. Your phone will ring like normal and the  LED light on the box will flash. When you answer the fone the LED will light and the caller will not be charged. Hang up the fone after you are done like normal.

            <p>Heh, I’ve got the books to go with this. This post you got off of machacking looks like a rip from said manuals. Here’s what the schematics of those look like (The Second schem. &amp; PC board are nonexistent in my copies though):</p>
<pre><code>Materials:
---------
1 1.8K 1/2 Watt Resistor
1 1.5V LED
1 SPST Switch

Procedure:
---------
(1) Open your phone by loosening the two screws on the bottom and
lifting the case off.
(2) There should be three wires: Red, Green, and Yellow. We'll be working
with the Red Wire.
(3) Connect the following in parallel:
     A. The Resistor and LED.
     B. The SPST Switch.
In other words, you should end up with this:
              (Red Wire)
           !---/\/\/\--O--!
(Line)-----!              !-----(Phone)
           !-----_/_------!
          /\/\/\ = Resistor
          O      = LED
          _/_    = SPST
</code></pre>

            <p>The sketchy formatting is mainly because the file I got it from is from a site that no longer exists and didn’t have any sort of formatting. It has stuff that makes sense in English, like tabbing at the beginning of a paragraph, but looks horrible  when you post it on a site with these kinds of formatting options. I’ll see what I can do to fix it.</p>
