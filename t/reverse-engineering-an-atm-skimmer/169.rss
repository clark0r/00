    <title>Reverse Engineering an ATM skimmer!</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/reverse-engineering-an-atm-skimmer/169</link>
    <description>&quot;When traveling, Elizabeth and I are always a little bit extra 
cautious; we hide money in special belts, we carry emergency cards in 3 
separate places, we never withdraw more than $100 from the ATM. One 
precaution Elizabeth always takes, is covering her PIN number with her 
left hand while she types it with her right. At first, I thought it was 
over-paranoid, but being a security researcher, I was soon covering my 
PIN everytime I typed it as well. Little did I know that this precaution
 would soon pay off…&quot;

In this article a security researcher discovers an ATM skimmer in the form of a stuck on pin-guard, and proceeds to reverse engineer it. This kind of crime is more prevalent than break in robberies, and more effective too.
