    <title>Is this course a good way to get the prerequisites to learning web hacking?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/is-this-course-a-good-way-to-get-the-prerequisites-to-learning-web-hacking/16060</link>
    <description>So I switch Udemy courses to one that includes PHP as well. I&#39;m trying to find a course that has languages that I can stick to that will get as many of the prerequisites to web hacking as possible so that I can practice and become a fluent web developer while still working towards learning web hacking while I&#39;m not thinking about it. I plan on making real websites for people in that time period.

Here&#39;s the new course that I got to replace the old one:

Here&#39;s all of the technologies it claims to cover:

What percentage of prerequisite languages to web app hacking are covered based on what you see?</description>

            <p>In addition to everything <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/device">@device</a> said, what helped me the most was understanding how the software stack works and how different components work with each other. Everything is connected.</p>
<p>I’ve had so many web devs argue with me over why an unsupported version of CentOS underneath their ReactJS app is a problem. What they don’t get is that their app firewall doesn’t mean shit if I can get RCE on the OS. If you can get that one exploit past sanitation, it’s all over.</p>
<p>Understanding the big picture is critical also. Web app hacking requires context since so much of the attack surface consists of end users, not developers. Maybe you got XSS - great, why should they care? Can you steal sessions? Drop other payloads?</p>
<p>Web technologies are very important to have a working knowledge of, but you’re really just working with another service on another port. It just so happens to be a service that can be highly complex as opposed to FTP or SMB. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/upside_down_face.png?v=9" title=":upside_down_face:" class="emoji" alt=":upside_down_face:"></p>

            <p>JavaScript, PHP and MySQL are useful for both.</p>
<p>In the browser you’ll see JavaScript, even if the source code is different, it has to be js in the end, so that’s definitely one to learn.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is is that you should start with PHP (it’s very beginner friendly, and also I think it’s the easiest one to exploit). Then you can jump to JS, it shouldn’t be a big step, and then to some Python (used for backends, but more importantly it’s a good scripting language you can use to automate tools/hax) and then maybe to Ruby or even Java.</p>
<p>For the tools part, git is sort of a must, but I think things like Bootstrap shouldn’t be taught, once you know some JS, HTML and CSS you can easily consume their docs (and there are many alternatives).</p>
<p>And there are many frameworks for each language and if applicable, each layer - my advice is: learn the basics first, then it’s going to be easier to choose which one makes the most sense to you.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out here, on Twitter or the 0x00 discord if I can help</p>
