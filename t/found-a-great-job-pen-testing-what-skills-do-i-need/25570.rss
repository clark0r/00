    <title>Found a great job pen testing, what skills do I need?</title>

    <description>Hi,

I found a great job as a pen tester. I have studied a lot and know how to use Kali and Parrot pretty well but how do I get some experience so I can apply for a job like this?

And what does it take? Sorry if this is a noob question but I really want to make a career in this.
