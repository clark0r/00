    <title>HackTheBox Weekly Challenge - Chaos</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/hackthebox-weekly-challenge-chaos/12075</link>
    <description>Hi 0x00ers! 

As you may be aware, this was originally an initiative started by our own @anon1115000 to help people get into HackTheBox and not feel alone while they&#39;re working away and building their skillsets.

Due to a very intense OSCP training on @anon1115000&#39;s part and job hunting, I will be taking the reigns for a little while until he is back in action!  

So without further ado, I present this weeks post:

------- 

# [Chaos](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/167)

## Box Info
I thoroughly enjoyed this box. Getting user on this was chaotic, to say the least. Enumeration is a key part of this, so be sure to leave no stone unturned! 

OS: Linux
Difficulty: Medium
Points: 30
Release Date: 15 Dec 2018

Thread Rules:

* No Spoilers
* [spoiler]No Spoilers[/spoiler]
* If you need to ask a question, please use `[spoiler][/spoiler]` tags if you think it&#39;ll reveal information
* Hints are allowed if they are vague, and oddly cryptic. Paint an [Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher) painting with your words
* Feel free to post that you pwned a box, but no write-ups. Nada
* Asking for help without effort on your part will be met with near fatal doses of sarcasm

N.B:
I will be watching the HTB twitter to know what challenges are being decommissioned so we don&#39;t lose forward progress in our rankings. They release this info on every 6-8 days so this post will always be on a Thursday/Friday. This is no guarantee however as they might decommission the week after. It&#39;s a numbers game so if we keep pwning we keep ranking up.
