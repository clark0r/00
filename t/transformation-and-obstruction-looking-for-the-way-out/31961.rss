    <title>Transformation and obstruction (Looking for the way out)</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/transformation-and-obstruction-looking-for-the-way-out/31961</link>
    <description>If u have read my &quot;funny dumbass story&quot;
Well here&#39;s the deal
I&#39;ve repaired my laptop
Building stuffs, kinda hard I won&#39;t lie, especially mobile apps especially when you&#39;re the only one doing it.
About the hacking group I wanted to open
We&#39;ve done a few hacks, but same old shi gets boring, especially when people you do things with aren&#39;t as dedicated as you are.
I hope to find highly talented people, I guess those better than I am and if I do and I&#39;m sure theirs no country firewall and internet barrier, I&#39;ll reinstall Linux in my pc.
Right now I&#39;m in a situation where I&#39;m not sure if I should move forward or backwards.
I love the previous advices I got on previous post and I hope to get better one here.</description>
