    <title>Need more detailed information about Tensilica TIE language</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/need-more-detailed-information-about-tensilica-tie-language/3445</link>
    <description>Few days ago I started to debug programm for Xtensa processors. Today i find out, that there is possible for user to create additional commands fot processor with [TIE Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensilica_Instruction_Extension). There is not very much documentation in the network and the software for creating commands with TIE, [Xtensa Xplorer](https://tensilicatools.com/download/xplorer-evaluation-download/), available only in demo version.

The questions are:

* Is it possible to find user-created commands in the ELF file? 

* If yes, where they can be?

* If no, how are they translated to the processor?

* How this commands can be translated to electrical signals correctly?

Thanks in advance.</description>
