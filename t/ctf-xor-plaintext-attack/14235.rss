    <title>CTF - XOR Plaintext Attack</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/ctf-xor-plaintext-attack/14235</link>
    <description>Hi everyone, I&#39;m having a problem with a challenge. Basically I have two encrypted messages and a message I know its clear text. Documenting myself on the network I discovered the attack xor with spread in clear. I&#39;m trying to write the resolution in python but I&#39;m having some problems. For the moment, I wrote this down:

&gt; Blockquote 
encrypted_message = &quot;655d5c4a185c4618584143155b5c4f19155a42585d50411448475a575114545b564b41454151585a114656515d5850&quot;.encode() 
respective_plaintext = &quot;This is our new, bullet-proof encryption scheme&quot;.encode()



Now, how do I get the key? I wrote:

&gt; Blockquote
key = encrypted_message ^ respective_plaintext but I get this error: TypeError: unsupported operand type (s) for : &#39;bytes&#39; and &#39;bytes&#39;



I turned the two messages into bytes and then tried to do the XOR to find the key.
Then, knowing the key, I would like to make the XOR of the key with the other encrypted message so that I can discover the message in clear.
Can you help me please? Thank you very much</description>
