    <title>How do you decode this?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/how-do-you-decode-this/21932</link>
    <description>Hello, community.

I&#39;ve been playing with some educational traffic captures from malware-traffic-analysis, and i wanted to get a bit dipper than just analyze pcap itself and answer training questions. I&#39;ve exported some file samples used during the attack and need some help to recover the kill chain.
So [here](https://pastebin.com/bN9mGqq7) is the contents of interest. 

Entropy analysis shows it is not encrypted (falls into &quot;regular English text&quot; range), so i presume its is some JS script. And the data itself kinda seems to be some variation of &quot;kid&#39;s secret language&quot;. But anyway i could not figure out who to crack such thing. Need advice on what is the general approach to such cases?</description>

            <p>Look’s  like you did not need help from anyone for this <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ,  nobody answering your post  gave you the push required i guess , dont feel sad if  there aren’t many people involved in your post  , and the question you just posted is better off on  the Discord channel (all the fun is there , just  hop in )</p>

            <p>Heh. As it usually happens, once you have asked someone, you magically figure out some key thing about the subject.</p>
<p>I have noticed, that there were not obfuscated symbols - dots, semicolons, slashes, etc. So i’ve decided to try just remove some repeating sequences. Particularly “f3t_542”. Cyberchef helped with this and in a second i had something much more readable. Next i did code beautify magic and found interesting chunk of data, obviously Base64 encoded. Several more mouse clicks and i see VBScript with the exact URL, i saw during PCAP analysis, hardcoded right into the script!</p>
<p>Why i didn’t notice all this immediately?</p>
