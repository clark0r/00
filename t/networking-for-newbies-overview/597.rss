    <title>Networking for Newbies | Overview</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/networking-for-newbies-overview/597</link>
    <description>Hello fellow 0x00ers! In this post, I am introducing my new series- **_&quot;Networking for Newbies&quot;._** 
When looking at networking basics, understanding the way a network operates is the first step to understanding it. In this series, I will give you an overview of the different terms and technologies commonly used. I will also include further links to help you understand the discussed topic better but researching and diving deep should be your work. This is the list of topics I will be covering in this series:

* DHCP
* NAT
* Subnetting
* IPv4 and IPv6
* Public vs Private IP
* DNS
* Routers &amp; Switches
*  VLANs
* OSI Model
*  MAC Addressing and the ARP Protocol

Once you are familiar with these technologies, you should be able to use the tools related to network hacking in pen-testing distros with a lot more comfort. Also, this will help you to understand how the Internet actually works. Looking forward to the responses I get!

            <p>Since I used to be posting networking articles on Null Byte and I’m planning to continue my series here, let me know which topics you want to cover so we can have a collab if you are interested so there won’t be any repetition.</p>
