            <p>If you’re asking how to get into the network, maybe you shouldn’t be on the Cisco gateway. Because gateway is a networking term to denote a demarcation point in a network as the default route all internal traffic goes through. This is usually called the default gateway. As such there is nothing Cisco owns product wise that’s just called gateway so already we have a couple issues here:</p>
<ul>
<li>What type of Cisco device is it?</li>
<li>Is it truly a gateway?</li>
<li>What is domain in your context?</li>
</ul>
<p>To me it seems like you don’t know enough about <em>how</em> to pivot from  a Cisco networking device, which begs the question on how you ended up on a Cisco device. Which then begs the question if you just used some PoC off of Github for a recently reported vulnerability affecting all Cisco XE IOS version’s http server.</p>
<p>Who knows, who cares.</p>

            <p>What attack vector and attack type did you use?, and for the domain controller you can use nmap -p389 -sV  to discover it.</p>
