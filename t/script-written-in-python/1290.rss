    <title>Script written in python</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/script-written-in-python/1290</link>
    <description> have been looking for Bind shell written in python and i found 2 scripts that look fine and the problem is that i dont know where to put my IP in both scripts in order to listen and get a connection...
console.py is the attacker (the question is where to put my IP)
server.py is the victim (the question is where to put my IP)



console.py --&gt;
https://github.com/Hadesy2k/python_backdoor/blob/master/console.py



server.py --&gt;
https://github.com/Hadesy2k/python_backdoor/blob/master/server.py

where to put my IP and PORT in order to get a conenction?</description>

            <p>Completely agree. Another side effect is, when you don’t know that the script does, you could just have downloaded malware and run it by your own free will. Nothing worse than that.</p>

            <p>Prior researches on google could have answered your question… I think that remedial courses about binding shell should help you to fully understand this topic. Lastly, avoid using tools / scripts that you don’t really understand … You don’t want to be a skid right ?</p>
<p>I’m sorry if it sounds harsh but this is mind-blowing. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/anguished.png?v=9" title=":anguished:" class="emoji" alt=":anguished:"></p>

            <p>In console.py, you don’t put the IP anywhere. You pass it as a command-line argument. The port is set in server.py, and you don’t need to leave your IP in server.py.</p>

            <p>An IP is the first argument to the program, the port is the second, and the password is third. Pay close attention to the last line of the first file…</p>
