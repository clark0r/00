# 0x01Why I make this tool?
I&#39;m working in a electronic commerce company as information security engineer, I need analyse risk in logs from online system. Log&#39;s size is always more than TB. It&#39;s hard to find vulnerability manually. So we  develope our tools for scanning work every day.
# 0x02 What&#39;s &quot;NoXss&quot;?
&quot;NoXss&quot; is a plugin  of our Web Scanner named Tiamat, a powerful xss scanner . It&#39;s really faster  and suitable for scanning big data.  We have used it to find 300+ xss rencently.
+ It used only 5 payloads based param&#39;s position to find xss risk rather than fuzzing. Fuzzing is open slowly and blind.
+ Phantomjs &amp; Chrome are used in this tool. That means it supports DOM based xss. We can open 4 or more browsers to work together, means faster.
+ Analysis. NoXss will create save many files for helping to analyse xss for users because some xss is diffcult to scan,such as Multiparted form request, WAF&#39;s deny, 302 redirect, etc.
+ Work with Burpsuite.  User can export their traffic data from Burpsuite to **.xml, then scan it. This is really a good function.
+ Support some headers like Cookie, Referer, Token or others,  this tool will add it automatically. So you don&#39;t worry the logined state or some header&#39;s check in backend.
+ NoXss is highly concurrent for using coroutine(Gevent).
# 0x03 Some result we have found
In fact, NoXss find lots of xss every day. Following are some example:
Sorry these examples are not allowed to open by 0x00sec&#39;s admin.
# 0x04 How to use it?
See details in https://github.com/lwzSoviet/NoXss. We have a release at https://github.com/lwzSoviet/NoXss/releases/tag/v1.0-beta
# 0x05 Our Plan
We  decide to open this plugin at https://github.com/lwzSoviet/NoXss firstly. The whole scanner &quot;Tiamat&quot; need more better plugins like command injection, ssrf, etc. We will open it in a few time.
Using &quot;NoXss&quot; and give me some advice or issues if you have interest in it.
