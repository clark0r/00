    <title>[ARG] The Red Triangle Solving -- Part2</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/arg-the-red-triangle-solving-part2/7368</link>
    <description>Hello folks, today I&#39;m going to continue **The Red Triangle** series.
If you haven&#39;t seen the first one yet, you can check it here:  [[ARG] The Red Triangle Solving — Part 1](https://0x00sec.org/t/arg-the-red-triangle-solving-part-1/7272) 

Last time, we have deciphered the Monoalphabetic Substitution symbols from the images and got a link to google drive, that lead us to the next link of the puzzle.
Now that we are all set, let&#39;s jump into it !

# Getting started
Once you open the link, you are prompted with the same symbolic red triangle ,as in the previous one, and underneath you have an interesting image.

![image2|690x350](upload://M5t4ciTxaai2XFtQvzW6drXUFE.png)
Also, on the background is playing an audio file, but this time, you can hear something strange at the beginning. We will get into that later.

I have viewed the source code and found this:
![source|469x339](upload://22ZimZ97kEM46mg3xeVvhN3cX53.png)
**Note:** _*apparently Coeus&#39;s was a Titan in the Greek mythology and represented rational intelligence.*_

Besides that, I found nothing, so I went on and downloaded the image and the audio file.

# The Image
At first glance, I thought that was something hidden in it ,as I thought on the previous one, and started to fire some tools on it, but found nothing... So, I thought maybe it has something to do with the meaning of the structure because I saw a pattern in the image.
I have started researching this kind of pattern and it&#39;s actually the Fibonacci sequence.
Besides that, I found nothing. 
_( If you guys want to have a look at it, contact me and maybe we could find something. I still think it&#39;s a message or some sort of thing in it. )_

# The Audio File
Ok, so this one got my attention since I entered the site, because you can hear in the first part of the song some strange &quot;satanic&quot; like voices. _(or it&#39;s just my mind that hears that. I&#39;M FINE OK!?)_
I popped up audacity ,after installing it, and started playing with the audio. It didn&#39;t seem to be something odd in the first place.
![audacity1|690x173](upload://g52vT0hIVtEyVsXhOaTFxzZK1oi.png)

But take a closer look....

![audacity2|559x300](upload://eQnjBb3040ZBCc0sCoRPYmaExlA.png)
If you listen to it to, in the first 30-40 seconds the song it&#39;s not started yet and those &quot;satanic&quot; voices are actually what we see here, in audacity. Maybe it&#39;s there on purpose.

So... we got something, but what can we do with it....?
I tried to reverse the audio, change its speed, research on hiding messages in audio files, with the hope that something might pop up, but... unfortunately, I got nothing.

In this moment, I started looking again at everything and analyze it more carefully than I have done before. After a few hours I found out that when you reverse it, the voices start to have more sense.
Then just made some speed adjustments, some coffee and finally got something.
Those &quot;satanic&quot; voices were just a robot who tells the next onion link for the puzzle.

_**By the way:**_  _this part was very struggling because the robots voice is really hard to hear and got a hard time getting what the link was. But hey, got it in the end._:face_with_monocle: 

The link was: [spoiler]https://paxt4n6urwx7uiah.onion.link/112417[/spoiler]
_At the moment the links are down, as far as I saw..._

# Conclusion
That was a new territory for me and had a lot of fun solving these puzzles.
Hope you guys loved it as much as I love making those articles and more importantly, I hope that you had fun.
Looking forward to see if you find something in the Fibonacci image and also hope you see in the next one.
Thanks for reading ! :grin:</description>
