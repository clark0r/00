    <title>Awful Phishing Attempt</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/awful-phishing-attempt/927</link>
    <description>Hey guys! Check out this awful phishing attempt I received in my email! For OPSEC reasons, I&#39;ve changed any occurrence of my name to &quot;Doe.&quot; Yes, he addressed me by my last name.

```text
Subject: Dear Doe,

Message:

Dear Doe,
 
I am Barrister Fredrick Adonko, a Legal adviser to my late client
Mr.D.E.Doe,a national of your country who dwelt and worked here for more than twenty years as a businessman and a major contractor to shell petroleum development company. After 

unsuccessful attempts to locate his relatives, I decided to contact you to assist  me and get this huge amount of 
(US$.9.5Million) left over in the Bank here in Lome-Togo, 
for more information reply me.

Thanks.
Barr. Fredrick .Adonko (Esq)
```

Obviously, as a white-hat community we would ___never___ attempt to phish people. However, take a second to enjoy this garbage email.

What are the obvious flaws in this email? Weak grammar and formatting make it obvious that this isn&#39;t a legit email from _any_ respectable law firm. Telling me about a &quot;late&quot; relative I&#39;ve never heard of is also another big no-no.

The &quot;attacker&#39;s&quot; email addresses: `fredbuka.lawfirm03@gmail.com` and `fredrick adonko &lt;fredrickadonkochambers@gmail.com&gt;` are similar to blacklisted emails found [here](http://www.joewein.de/sw/dbl-update/2013-08-28.htm).

            <p>Edward Snowden is defined as a criminal because he exposed the truth of a corrupt nation.</p>
<p>We would be defined criminals because we got butthurt over a single, non-important and terrible phishing mail.</p>
<p>One is whistleblowing, and the other is just overreacting. There is a clear difference between the two. So aye, Edward Snowden is not a bad person due to the nature of his “crimes”. If we hack and ruin this guy’s life on the other hand…</p>
<p>It would be like beating someone to death with a wrench just because he pushed you on purpose.</p>
<p>EDIT: now just trolling him a bit won’t hurt. In fact, it is a good way to teach them a lesson. But hacking them might be a bit over the top.</p>

Dear Doe,
 
I am Barrister Fredrick Adonko, a Legal adviser to my late client
Mr.D.E.Doe,a national of your country who dwelt and worked here for more than twenty years as a businessman and a major contractor to shell petroleum development company. After 

unsuccessful attempts to locate his relatives, I decided to contact you to assist  me and get this huge amount of 
(US$.9.5Million) left over in the Bank here in Lome-Togo, 
for more information reply me.

Thanks.
Barr. Fredrick .Adonko (Esq)

<p>Obviously, as a white-hat community we would <em><strong>never</strong></em> attempt to phish people. However, take a second to enjoy this garbage email.</p>
<p>What are the obvious flaws in this email? Weak grammar and formatting make it obvious that this isn’t a legit email from <em>any</em> respectable law firm. Telling me about a “late” relative I’ve never heard of is also another big no-no.</p>
<p>The “attacker’s” email addresses: <code>fredbuka.lawfirm03@gmail.com</code> and <code>fredrick adonko &lt;fredrickadonkochambers@gmail.com&gt;</code> are similar to blacklisted emails found <a href="http://www.joewein.de/sw/dbl-update/2013-08-28.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
