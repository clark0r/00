    <title>Need some advice re Android DF</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/need-some-advice-re-android-df/7977</link>
    <description>Can you recommend an Android forensics tool that I can use to pull data from an old handset? It doesn&#39;t have TWRP on it. I&#39;m also unable to fire up any VMs at the moment. Is there any way I can take an image of the handsets without TWRP? 

Thanks.</description>
