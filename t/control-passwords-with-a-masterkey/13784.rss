    <description>Hi there!
Anyone know of any program in which you can manage other passwords of sites, apps, etc with a masterkey? I found some in the net, but I trust more of the recommendations of the community, thank you very much.</description>

            <p>I would recommend any kind of offline password manager (Keepass 2 comes to mind).<br>
The reason for my choice is that they are not online. The issue with an online solution, in my opinion, is that you’re still handing over your master-key and trusting someone else with it…<br>
Now if for example someone found a way to access their databases and read out hashes or something of equal/higher value (which isn’t unheard of) then everyone who registered with them is instantly <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/control-passwords-with-a-masterkey/13784/3">spoiler</a></span><br>
When someone finds a flaw in an offline password manager then they also need access to your DB file or your machine (and if they have that then you have way bigger problems anyway)<br>
Just make sure to keep an up-to-date backup of the DB somewhere.<br>
(But I agree that an online solution is way more convenient // As always it comes down to the “security - convenience” trade-off)</p>

            <p>Lastpass seems to be the best from all the reviews I have read. Works in your browser as well as on phone and other devices.</p>
