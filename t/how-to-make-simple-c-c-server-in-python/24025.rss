    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/how-to-make-simple-c-c-server-in-python/24025</link>
    <description>Hello I&#39;m try to make simple reverse shell handler like metasploit multi handler or netcat but I want to make mine own script,so main problem was I want to interact multiple connection for example in netcat I can evade Anti Virus software&#39;s so easily
but I can&#39;t interact multiple client reverse shells.

Can someone help me for this simple command and control server in Python . I&#39;m okay for any given advice.
(I developed my own Malware for reverse shell with C++ but I don&#39;t want to use open source command and control servers)</description>
