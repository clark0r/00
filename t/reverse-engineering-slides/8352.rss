    <title>Reverse engineering slides</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/reverse-engineering-slides/8352</link>
    <description>Hi
A while ago I did a presentation on reverse engineering for a group at a local uni.
I thought the slides and binaries I used could be useful, so I&#39;m posting it here.
I&#39;d like to point out that many of the binaries I used are not mine, many came from skidophrenia which was hosted on ctfd.io by @_py. The other crackmes which I didn&#39;t write were from [NoREPls](https://0x00sec.org/t/crackme-norepls-part-1/2974) by @dtm. 
I&#39;d also like to thank @Leeky along with some people I know irl (C_Sto, kronicd and curryhacker) for checking over the slides for me.

I uploaded it [here](https://github.com/lkw657/reversing_slides)</description>

            <p>I have some links to more information on the last slide. The main thing I would recommend is <a href="https://beginners.re/">this free book</a>. Also, do challenges, I’d start with the ones provided under crackmes.</p>
