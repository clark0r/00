    <title>What is the difference between Antivirus Programs and things like Sophos/B2B Security Solutions?</title>

    <description>Hey.
Does anyone know what makes the difference between f.e. the windows Defender and the services provided for B2B Customers from companies like Sophos?

Like in which points would it be harder for an attacker to get his dirty hands on a system in a company getting services from these companies, compared to a system with just Win Defender / Antivirus and no external protection from a company like these?</description>
