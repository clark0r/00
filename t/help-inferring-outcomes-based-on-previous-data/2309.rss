    <title>Help: Inferring outcomes based on previous data</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/help-inferring-outcomes-based-on-previous-data/2309</link>
    <description>I have a rather simple problem that&#39;s somewhat out of my field of expertise, any help would be appreciated. :slight_smile:

I have a data set similar to this:

	+-----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
	|   TIME    | BV  | C1  | C2  | C3  | C4  | ... |
	+-----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
	|           |     |     |     |     |     |     |
	| timestamp |     | 2   | 6   | 10  | 9   | ..  |
	|           |     |     |     |     |     |     |
	| timestamp |     | -6  | -10 | -17 | -4  | ... |
	|           |     |     |     |     |     |     |
	| timestamp |     | -7  | -15 | -14 | -12 | ... |
	|           |     |     |     |     |     |     |
	| timestamp |     | 11  | 16  | 12  | 9   | ... |
	|           |     |     |     |     |     |     |
	| ...       | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
	+-----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

Basically these datasets go on for 10s of millions of rows. There are approx 200 more columns though often 90%+ of them are NULL (meaning no data was collected).

BV == base value, and the CN cols are the percentage difference the other collectors reported compared to the main value.

What I want to do is given 3 rows of data predict, based off the whole dataset, the likely next N rows of data we&#39;ll collect. I plan to start predicting just the next 1 row but perhaps extending out to 3 or 4 would be good.

It seems to me that using bayesian inference to model probable outcomes would be ideal, but am looking for others thoughts before I set off on this project.

Thanks for reading, looking forward to any other approaches anyone may have.</description>
