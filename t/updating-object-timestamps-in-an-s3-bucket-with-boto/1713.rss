    <title>Updating object timestamps in an s3 bucket with boto</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/updating-object-timestamps-in-an-s3-bucket-with-boto/1713</link>
    <description>I&#39;m going to keep putting these tutorials in here until @oaktree makes an &quot;ops&quot; category just for me ;) And I realize pretty much all of us here are in infosec in some way or another and not really &quot;ops&quot; people, but bear with me. All these little things are going to come in useful someday somehow. I promise.

Now, onto the post...

So tonight because of some vendor&#39;s stupidity, I had to update the timestamps on all the objects in an S3 bucket to something less than 24h old, ie, &quot;now&quot;. How do I do that? No idea. But I knew I had to start with my trusty Swiss Army Knife for AWS: python3 + [boto3]. 

Firing up boto, and python, I sketched out my short script. I knew I needed to do the following:

1. Create a boto &quot;client&quot; object
2. Enumerate all the objects in the given bucket
3. For each of those objects, bump the timestamp to &quot;now&quot; somehow. 

Steps 1 and 2 were easy. Step 3 was less clear: boto has no method to modify metadata directly. At least, none that I could find. What to do? A bit of Googling turned up a Github [issue] describing the use of `copy_object()` pointing to the same source and dest key. It&#39;s the boto version of `touch`, sorta. It&#39;s not documented and it&#39;s not really obvious.

So there you have it: If you want to `touch` an object in an S3 bucket, the best way to do it is to use `client.copy_object()` with the same source and destination.

            <p>This is cool. But would you mind doing a somewhat crash course of AWS and or buckets?</p>
<p>Fun fact: this site uses AWS as a CDN.</p>

            <p>Small caveat: You have to change <em>something</em> about an S3 key in order for you to copy back to the same source, so you’ll probably want to change the storage class.</p>
