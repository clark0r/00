    <title>What output from vulnerability scanners are to be presented to clients?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/what-output-from-vulnerability-scanners-are-to-be-presented-to-clients/19517</link>
    <description>Hi everyone!

I&#39;m new here to 0x00sec, so let me start off by introducing myself. I am a Cyber Crime &amp; Security student who is currently doing an internship for a last semester at a company that is interested in doing vulnerability assessments for their clients.

As such I am currently tasked with testing out Nessus, OpenVAS and RapidFire Tools Inspector. Now my question is what output from these scanners are important to show to clients (which are small to medium companies). An additional question I have is if anyone has any strong opinions of which one is the best and why they would be?

Thanks in advance, community!</description>
