    <description>Dear community,
I saw a lot of network scanners in the Web. Could you please clarify, if I will use some of them do I violate the law? How can I do it anonymously (scan some host)?</description>

            <p>you could actually contact the vps provider and have them whitelist you , as far as i know digital ocean recognizes ethical hackers for their contibution , and whitelist their vps, that happens when you have something to show them that you are a good guy , like a hackerone profile.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for your answer! I heard that sometimes your VPS could be blocked by the report and even I will register the VPS I should to pay for it usage (from my VISA or…) could you please explain how mature hackers do that (to stay anonym)?</p>

            <p>As far as I know, it’s perfectly legal but it will attract some unwanted attention.<br>
As to doing it anonymously, use a VPS I suppose, one that protects your identity. You can scan 24/7 with it.</p>
<p>I would also recommend you check out the following DEFCON presentation:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk-21p2m8YY">DEFCON 16: Nmap: Scanning the Internet</a></p>
