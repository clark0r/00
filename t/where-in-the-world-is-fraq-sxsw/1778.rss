    <title>Where in the world is fraq? SxSW</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/where-in-the-world-is-fraq-sxsw/1778</link>
    <description>I saw @oaktree asking where I was and figured I&#39;d let y&#39;all know so you&#39;d quit worrying. I&#39;ve been at SxSW since Sunday and I give a talk tomorrow morning some time about how to not screw up a hackathon. 

Bad news: It won&#39;t be recorded like I previously thought. Sorry, peeps. 

Cool news: I had an intimate, hour-long talk with the father of the internet and co-creator of TCP/IP, Vint Cerf. The dude is awesome.

I also met a few other interesting folks (some of whom you&#39;d recognize) and hope to shake hands with Stephen Wolfram tomorrow before I have to head out. This is an amazing (if expensive) conference and you should make every effort to find some way to get in if you can. I&#39;ll do a more detailed breakdown of my time here eventually.

See y&#39;all again in a few days!</description>
