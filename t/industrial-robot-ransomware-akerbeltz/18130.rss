    <description>Hello folks,

Following [prior work](https://ioactive.com/exploiting-industrial-collaborative-robots/) exploiting Universal Robots cobots, we&#39;d like to present Akerbeltz as a ransomware targeting industrial robots.

Essentially, the malware can be deployed via an adjacent network of physically as displayed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7fcV5j1t0 leaving the robot with the following status:
