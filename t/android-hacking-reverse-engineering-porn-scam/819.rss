    <description># The Android Series
Hi everyone ! 
Some of you may know that I started an Android Hacking series. The serie focus on Android Malware and Reverse engineering.
Since I started this guide, I search a lot on android malware and find some Good/Bad(Security improvement) news in this field.

The news Android 4.4+ Os are a little more secure from malware (Good to know that). Android application can&#39;t start at boot if the user didn&#39;t start the application once by clicking on the icon. 

Old Android can rooted though these exploit and &quot;Hacked&quot; with : 

* [TowelRoot](http://tinyhack.com/2014/07/07/exploiting-the-futex-bug-and-uncovering-towelroot/) 
* Framaroot
* [Webview](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/android-hacking-security-part-7-attacks-android-webviews/)

# How a Malware can gain access on my device ? 

Scam, Phishing, Porn. This is the most common way malware propagate

*The Mazare Bot* malware, use one of the above method. The user receive an sms telling him to download the malware to be able to see an mms.

Some other malware ( Not only android ) use clickbait to propagate : 

ex : 
Facebook post : Leak nude of Emma watson, Cat killed by a man
You can imagine everything, you&#39;ll just have to trick the user to click on the link.

Social engineering is a great technique for malware to propagate.  

The Android Malware tutorial , that I&#39;m writting will not help you to create a good malware. 

My Android serie won&#39;t cover : 

**How to make the perfect undetectable malware that will stay persistent and steal your mom&#39;s money because your dad clicked on a bad link**

However, I will cover some aspect that I can understand and apply.

Here is what I&#39;m still learning for my Malware serie : 

- Stay persistent ( Yes, we will cover this aspect )
- Find a way to hide the malware ( I didn&#39;t figure how I can do it for the moment )
- Connect to a server to receive command 
- check if the device is rooted
- ( root the device ) 

What I can&#39;t do : 

* rewritting the towelroot

#Why ?

This is really obscure for me to know how to rewrite an exploit. I&#39;m still learning how to write exploit and understand common vulnerabilities ( Race Condition, Format String bug, Buffer overflow ). If you&#39;re really interested in making malware, here how you can root a device from a malware.

* Rewritting towelroot exploit and compile a binary
* Lauch the towelroot apk from your malware

And here a little polls, My android series is not only on malware making. I will talk about RE of android app too. 
I want your views on this serie.

How should I do the RE series
