    <title>macOS Material - Following up on my post a few months ago looking for macOS internals/reversing/malware reference</title>

    <description>I posted here a while back looking for some more specific resources regarding macOS internals, reversing, malware analysis. Just wanted to follow up with what I found and **thank everyone** for the guidance. It has proven essential in the work I&#39;ve been able to do. 

*  [Objective-See](https://objective-see.com/) has great tools and an online book, that&#39;s an amazing reference. 

*  I had completely forgot about [VX_Underground](https://vx-underground.org/papers.html) and their growing library of all things malware. Absolutely essential.

*  There are many resources I&#39;ve been using the past months. Here&#39;s a Gist with url&#39;s. Haven&#39;t labled or linked, yet. [Gist with sites/reference I use](https://gist.github.com/hartescout/765ab7c4c08ef2f481f58f633b05e9d4)</description>
