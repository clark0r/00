        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>first get a list of the file :</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="hashtag">#include</span> &lt;Windows.h&gt;</p>
<p>vector get_all_files_names_within_folder(string folder)<br>
{<br>
vector names;<br>
string search_path = folder + “/<em>.</em>”;<br>
WIN32_FIND_DATA fd;<br>
HANDLE hFind = ::FindFirstFile(search_path.c_str(), &amp;fd);<br>
if(hFind != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {<br>
do {<br>
// read all (real) files in current folder<br>
// , delete ‘!’ read other 2 default folder . and …<br>
if(! (fd.dwFileAttributes &amp; FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY) ) {<br>
names.push_back(fd.cFileName);<br>
}<br>
}while(::FindNextFile(hFind, &amp;fd));<br>
::FindClose(hFind);<br>
}<br>
return names;<br>
}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then open the file and write hello world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“hello world”&gt;&gt;names</p>
</blockquote>
<p>for multi threadeing you need thread :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>thread t1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and set t1 for funection (list or open file or write file or all and …)</p>
<p>if you work on windows use powershell .<br>
or use autoit .its so easy.<br>
