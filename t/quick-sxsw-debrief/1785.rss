    <title>Quick SxSW debrief</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/quick-sxsw-debrief/1785</link>
    <description>Sunday:

- No talks, but I did hang out on the trade show floor and see some awesome booths.
-  NASA booth was _amazing_. 
- Everyone was crowded around the CIA booth for some weird reason. 
- Facebook Live was conspicuously crammed into a small booth way off in the corner, away from the action.
- Went to the IEEE Hack for Humanity party (involved with that in a way I can talk about later)
    - At said party, sat down and had an hour-long, private chat with Vint Cerf, the Chief Scientist at Dolby, a journalist from TED, and a data scientist from NASA.
        - Remembering the 0x00sec conversation about humanities and liberal arts, I asked Vint his opinion. He said those who disregard liberal arts and humanities are idiots.
        - He told me to follow up with him in an email about some other things because he wants to hear what I have to say.
- This awesome group called Two Bit Circus was hosting the party with lots of amazing, nerdy interactive exhibits but I was too giddy from meeting Vint to pay much attention.
- I did however get a margarita made by a robot bartender. It was terrible. We have a long way to go in that department.

Monday:

- More trade show. Notable booth: Startup called SnapBud(?) that lets you take a picture of your marijuana bud and let their computer vision service diagnose problems with your grow.
- Went to a talk by two of my friends and coworkers at my consulting firm, Quite Uncommon.
- Went to a talk by Dr. Jeffrey Heer, who runs the Interactive Media Lab at Washington State. The IML produced d3.js, DataWrangler, and other data vis tools. 
    - Snagged Dr. Heer after the talk and got to chat with him for 20-30 mins on a number of things, including visualizing 2D data in a 3D space
- Back to the trade floor where I played with some amazing AR/VR tech.
- Best BBQ brisket of my life that night

Tuesday:

- Gave my talk
- Ran to catch my plane</description>

<p>Also. I watched your talk on twitter and it was really good.</p>
