    <description>Hi 0x00’ers, and all those that took part in 0x00ctf 2017!

First off, we want to thank all of our challenge creators, admins, and participants. CTFs are a great opportunity for us as a community to sharpen our skills, challenge ourselves and each other with new problems, and meet new people who share our passion for information security. This event was a great success.

These creators are @_py, @0x00pf, @dtm, @oaktree, @exploit and @pry0cc &lt;small&gt;(kinda)&lt;/small&gt;      

As most of you know the first prize for this CTF was a **Binary Ninja** license donated to us by [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/), one of our [Partners](https://init.0x00sec.org/partners.html)... But, before we announce the winner, here are a few preliminary stats.

The most-solved challenge was @oaktree’s C++ **challenge-000 (guessme)**; the least-solved was @0x00pf’s **challenge-009 (OBFS)**. The challenges will remain available after the contest.
