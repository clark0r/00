    <description># We, the Ones who Rule the World: A new manifest by Thirsty-Robot
&lt;br&gt;
We all know that the world has changed. Things aren’t the same as they were 20 years ago. And mostly in a field of study so vast as computer science or security. New individual are coming to the field every day; “How are websites made?”, “Why do I have internet”, the questions we’ve all asked, and the ones that other generations will ask too. Computers have grow smaller, thinner, more complex, and even amusing. New generations don’t have the tools to explore this, not because they don’t want to, but because companies don’t let them. If you have an Iphone, go ahead and look at it, do you see any screws, do you even see a lid that can be open, besides the SD and SIM compartment? The answer is a big well-deserved NO. It’s almost as it was planned.

The world has changed and not for good. Everything is connected, everyone can know who you are on a simple Facebook or Google search (assuming that you use this services). Yes, you can change the default configuration, but how is a kid going to know this if he has never seen how his father opens the cover of his phone to get the battery out. For the new generations it just works and that’s it. New generation are not aware of how their data is being manipulated, how every stroke, every character they type is monitored, they were borned in a giant role-play of 1984. 

We as hackers need to change this. We need to share with new generations, we need to make open-source projects “meta”. We, more than most individuals have the potential to change the modern world. We understand how it works, we understand on what it is based. As you read this, your government is maybe fighting a hacker, or other global powers on the internet. Computers are everything. There is not Illuminati, there is not “giant see it all eye”, there is only us. The guy who helped the teacher with her or his computer, the guy who made a pirate radio for fun, the guy who eats books on every subject, the guy that it’s full of curiosity, the guy that wanted to hack his favorite game to buy an item. 

We are the ones that created the systems which makes our lives so easy. We are the cool guys now, we are not weird anymore, we have a voice, we are something. Correction we are everything.

We, are the ones who rule the world, let’s show them…</description>

            <p>I might not be as eloquent as some of you but I feel I might have some thoughts to share on that as well <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Aldous Huxley shared at some point the idea of being a <em>pontifex</em> as he described, aka a bridge-builder of sorts. His interest in creating a language that could connect different aspects of human understanding and make it easier to different groups to communicate and express their ideas was his motto for most of his life.</p>
<p>I’m bringing this up because, what I realised growing up the way I did — struggling to understand my place in society while tinkering with computers and all tech shenanigans I could pull off —  to eventually transitioning to this industry, is that we lack the ability to express ourselves for the most part, when we are not amongst people alike. A huge part of my job today is translating technological concepts in a way that makes sense to people that don’t care about it or don’t think they have a say on it. And boy, it’s hard.</p>
<p>We (as hackers, tinkers, curious, weirdos) were never the majority and we will never be, so we might as well accept the fact we are not in the driver’s seat as we think we are. I don’t mean this in a nihilistic way, I think our contributions as people who deeply understand and care for technology can be tremendous —  as it has been. Sometimes however, I feel we gotta tone down the “we are the ones / the chosen ones” kinda talk and understand that, unless we break out of the bubble in order to expand collaboration, much of the changes we want to see are doomed to fail. There are so many amazing projects out there, both from the idealistic &amp; technical standing point, but all we see is people talking about that kid that phished someone and broke into Uber — not that I didn’t appreciate seeing that in one way or another, but you know what I mean. This where we are.</p>
<p>Apart from that, Always refreshing to see someone putting those ideas out there so I’m happy I came across this <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> It saddens me to look around and see a community of people whose abilities are indeed, more important than ever these days, doing shitty <code>r/b(e|ug)/</code> bounties in exchange for stupid energy drinks and believing they are doing something good.</p>
<p>As I said, not as articulate as you all but I just wanted to say this: when technology is used as the end goal instead of the means to something better, it’s just not worth it. This my two cents.</p>

            <p>This is very true. At a glance, it seems that hacker culture has some form of elitism (not necessarily bad), accompanied by a ton of gatekeeping, as well as technical requirements. Plus, due to its nature, it’s a pretty reserved space. To indulge in it, you’d first have to venture into the net, and find forums such as this one, or find some obscure IRC channel where other hackers gather. Other texts are never published since many find publishing houses are very copyright-centric and well, hackers tend to dislike both authority and closing off knowledge so, no more explanations needed. This is all conjecture of course, I lack the data required to make a more certain analysis, but we can indulge in theories and generalization.</p>

<p>If you find the time, try it. You will find an audience for sure.<br>
I was at the library today to buy some philosophy books and out of curiosity I always check out the popular science books, it’s distressing the lack of books on ethics applied to cyber or just testimony.<br>

            <p>Hey. I appericate your move with regards to acknowledging how technology affects society and how the hacker ethic can be applied to all kinds of different parts of human life. I also respect how you are well read in this subject matter (for example, I have not heard of <em>The Society of the Spectacle</em> before reading this).</p>
<p>Here are my two pennies regarding what you wrote — specifically the original manifesto (not your follow up comments, and keep in mind, a lot of my response is based on my subjective take of the world, so take it with a "grain of salt <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> .</p>

<p>First, please don’t take this personally, but you may want to work a bit on grammar and spelling. I’m not trying to hate or anything (in fact, I myself have lousy grammar and spelling — feel free to take the piss out of <a href="https://medium.com/@EpsilonCalculus" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">my Medium articles</a> if you want). I say this because your article was a little hard to read (tho it can also be my silly autistic brain having the letters “bouncing off my head” lol). I recommend submitting drafts of your works to <a href="https://www.critiquecircle.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Critique Circle</a> for proofreading purposes.</p>

<p>Now I want to actually address the “meat” of what you said. I totally agree with youself on how the world has changed since the turn of the millenium. I have had this discussion with family and friends: websites like YouTube and Twitter, and the blogosphere were not what they used to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/YflsCectl6I" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">“EmpLemon” (2017)</a> discussed the political economy of YouTube and how the incentives for content creators have “nudged” them into creating lousy content. One of the things that make me feel sad is that the internet is <strong>too</strong> ubiqutious, and I really with that it was not powerful enough to be an engine for economic growth or influencing the political process.</p>
<p>I also agree with you on how design has became more proprietary over the years. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/rossmanngroup/videos" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Louis Rossman</a> has discussed this and worked with this problem as an independent repair technician. I recommend checking him out if you want to learn more. Many technology companies also intentionally make their products more prone to breakdown to create an artifical demand for more of them (<a href="https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/55526/Keeble_Daniel.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllo" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Keeble 2013</a>; <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/158299081.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Rodriguez et al. 2015</a>; <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/25148486221076136" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Taffel 2022</a>).</p>
<p>I suppose where I disagree with yourself is on the stuff to do with hackers being powerful in this new world. Technical skills are great, but they can only get you so far (and sometimes, like in my case, not that far at all). I am still in my mid-twenties and living with parents, despite having decent technical skills. Social skills are very important as well; one should be able to collaborate in teams in order to accomplish a big task. This is something that I (and possibly other hackers) have struggled with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We as hackers need to change this. We need to share with new generations, we need to make open-source projects “meta”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am definiately with you there! The application of hacker ethic and open source principles have been increasing since the internet became more widespread. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a movement to make medicine more “open source” (see <a href="http://www.opensourcepharma.net" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Open Source Pharma, n.d.</a>). The scientific discipline of <em>drug discovery</em> is starting to be more open sourced as well — with India leading the proverbial way (<a href="http://www.osdd.net/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Open Source Drug Discovery, n.d.</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A worldwide movement of <em>open science</em> and open scholarship is taking steam. This is something that I personally have a huge interest in, and can spend literally hours discussing. But I will give some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-New-Statistics-Estimation-Science-ebook/dp/B01LZDQBS8/?tag=0x00sec03-20" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Cumming &amp; Jagerman (2016)</a> introduce quantitative research in the context of open science. They go over the usual stuff like confidence intervals, p-values, regression analysis, et cetera. But they also discuss how to think like an amateur scientist, how to use computers to get stuff done, how to plan a research project, the replication crisis (see <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Open Science Collaboration, 2015</a>) and basically the statistics needed to be a 1337 hacker-scientist <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">
</li>
<li>Speaking of “hacker-scientists,” that’s how one of the authors described themselves in the first volume of <em>The Theoretical Minimum</em> <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Theoretical-Minimum-Start-Doing-Physics/dp/0465075681" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Susskind &amp; Hrabovsky (2014)</a>. This book is just amazing if you want to open source all the physics things!</li>
<li>Though keep in mind that there are some limitations to open science. For example, there is a concern that science may be misused as a political tool and some research will be of low-quality. My favourite example of this is the <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/OpenPsych_pseudojournals" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><em>OpenPsych</em> journals</a> and one of its pseudoscientists: Noah Carl. <a href="https://doi.org/10.26775/OQSPS.2016.06.28" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Carl (2016)</a> published a study where he said that Moslems are destroying European countries and pooled data from (I shit you not) a website called “<a href="http://TheReligionOfPeace.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">TheReligionOfPeace.com</a>”. That should tell you everything you need to know about OpenPsych and Noah Carl (who later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190703134533/https://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/files/attachments/Investigation%20report%20for%20the%20website.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">got b&amp; from his university</a>). There are plenty of examples of bad open science and predatory journals (see <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.23265" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Xia et al. 2015</a>), so be “on guard” when being an open scientist should you choose to become one <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last open source hot topic that I can think of atm is the maker movement. Sadly, I don’t have enough experience with hardware and computer engineering to confidently give an opinion. But I hear that <a href="https://all3dp.com/2/3d-printed-house-cost/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">3D printed houses are becoming a thing</a> <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/fire.png?v=12" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is something that I have mixed feelings about. While I do agree that hackers did a lot to build technology into what it is today, I feel that having a morbidly curious mind paired with an knack for tinkering is not enough to make the greater society “bend to our will.” Individuals like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are more like businessmen than actual hackers (in fact, Zuckerberg and Musk stole their “ideas” (and memes) from others; see <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3391856&amp;page=1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Michels (2009)</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-hard-drive-stolen-meme-twitter-credit-1848995870" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Bardhan (2022)</a> and <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-stolen-meme" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Robitzski (2021)</a>. User <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/m242">@m242</a> also noted that “[t]he FAANGS are this efficient totalitarian system, and you can’t change it because no one cares” — which is a self-evident statement that needs no citation <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=12" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Again, my partial disagreement with this statement is not substantiated with hard facts or statistics. These are just my personal opinion and feelings based on casual experiences. Take it with a proverbial grain of salt <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

</blockquote>
<p>I do have a tad of personal experience with this. I did not live with my father growing up and lived with my single mum, but despite the lack of father figure, I was able to be self-taught in computers (in fact, I dropped out of community college to re-enrol in a distance learning programme cos my professors were too damn boring lmao). I never used social media until I was an adult (with the exception of a few forums, and I went by pseudonyms in those forums). I think that, despite the propaganda of large companies, people naturally want to learn new things.</p>

<p>Honestly, I could probably write a book fatter than Marx’s <em>Das Kapital</em> series outlining my philosophy of hacking (I’ll save that for when my ideas are more mature). I saw that you came back with a more mature development of your ideas some time later when responding to another user. Nonetheless, both the original and mature writings gave me something to think about. The world is changing and hackers, along with other kinds of people, can hopefully help to prevent it from devolving into a dumpster fire <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/grimacing.png?v=12" title=":grimacing:" class="emoji" alt=":grimacing:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This reminds me of the opening line in a documentary about Ross Ulbricht.</p>
<p>“It’s no longer the era of industry, we’re in a technological era fundamentally. The fascists, they have the resources, but we have imagination. We are making the tools to take back out sovereignty. (…) The fascists always use the narrative of ‘we are the white knights in shining armor protecting against the threats, we come here and we move out the dark with pure whiteness’. That’s a false narrative, because there is corruption in those castles. The real base of power lies with us.”</p>
<p>I believe an important battle being overlooked is the battle for the label of “Web3”, where big companies are using “decentralization” as a distraction from their corporate integration and control of the world. Will “Web3” be a term to describe the draconian technological dystopia or the utopia built by the technological architects, those who both have power and understand it’s importance?</p>
<p>Because we live in a technological era, it is truly those who know about technology that rule this world and have the tools to take back the aforementioned sovereignty. The elites are frightened of the technologically literate, they just want you to take the next dopamine shot from the app and phone and network that you don’t have a clue about.</p>
<p>It is troubling to see that education about technology is reduced down to shitty web frameworks and working for FAANG instead of teaching people the true power of technology. Every good technology wizard is self-taught, you could even say this for STEM in general, no college degree is ever going to replace working on your laptop all night long coding.</p>
<p>Whenever you talked about the world changing for the worse, I think it is because of the lack of privacy and localization in human communities overall. Technology is essentially being used to globalize and publicize every aspect of our existence rather than improving human life. They are ignoring what it means to be human and essentially make money at the expense of the mental and social fabric of society. If you have no knowledge or no incentive to know how technology works then you get a population that is powerless in the face of something so seemingly complex.</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>Interesting point. You are right on that, people will never like to know how stuff works. In a way is like Guy Deboard said on his book <em>The Society of the Spectacle</em>, by knowing how something works, you make the “magic” go away. Another philosopher talks about this subject with the analogy of showing a magic trick to a kid: if you show a magic trick to a kid, he will not be impressed because this magic trick is a new concept for him, but if you show a magic trick to an adult he will be astonished as he knows it’s not possible.</p>
<p>We (hackers and programmers) also fall into a loop hole in which we created  the systems that are controlling us, as you mentioned. I believe that a society will never change and start using dApps,  investing in bitcoin and using an ad blocker just because ideology.</p>
<p>Now, tha way we educate is also a problem too. You see, understading Open Source, the blockchain, etc, is hard if you are not into this. Is just like what happens on politics now at days. Most people (at least in my community) are situated in the right wing of the political axis. Why? Because the ideas of the left are hard to understand. It’s easier to make a vague logical assumption of why socialism “doesn’t work”, example:</p>
<hr>
<p>USA = High GDP<br>
High GDP = Work<br>
USA = Capitalism<br>
Capitalism = World Power = Good shit</p>
<hr>
<p>Venezuela = Socialist<br>
Venezuela = Economical crisis<br>
Socialism = Bad</p>
<hr>
<p>The right makes more sense, because data shows us that capitalism works and socialism and comunism does not. It’s easier to see numbers than to read Foucalt, Chomsky, Marx, Zizek etc. And make a complete analysis of why socialism hasn’t work.</p>
<p>The same happens whenever we start talking about dapps or the blokchain etc etc… Most people need a proof of concept, the FAANGS offer this in different types of what I called capitals or tokens. Social tokens, Material tokens, Fun tokens etc… This tokens (or capitals) can work as a prove of concept. But, you see, some one already taked about this, and predicted pretty much what would happen. I’m talking about the father of existensialism: Kierkegaard.</p>
<p>Kierkegaard critized this, as we are losing identity in the name of rationsalism, because is rational to think that this tokens work (because they do). But then, when all of our identity becomes drained we then get lost in what Kierkegaard called <em>the finites of life</em>. And then, we become a, I hate to use this word, we become “sheeps”. Now, what I mean by this is that we don’t really know how to educate. We should be more simple, encapsulated and TO NOT be smart asses. People cannot just take this “leap of faith” into stop using Facebook or Google, because they are still very much in awe by the amount of tokens they get by using them.</p>
<p>At the time I wrote this “manifesto”, I had a more encapsulated look of the world and how it should work. I believed that STEM was the answer to everything and yep, I was wrong. I’ve been growing up and also I think that my role in this community has changed. I love CS, but I also love philosophy and I have been reading and thinking alot in this area. I would love to create a new “manifesto”, one that is not ““Look at me, I’m the edgy kid in technology”” but one that can be taken seriously, one with decent ideas backed by observation and theory.</p>
<p>If you are interested PM me <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am happy to see that I am not the only one feeling this way, however, I disagree on one point:<br>
<em>We</em> don’t rule the world, <em>they</em> do, and as you said, they are using this power to gain even more control.<br>
The big tech companies have become a power thirsty cancer, and we, hackers, are the only ones that can bite the hand that feeds enslaving food back.</p>
<p>As I see it, the only question is “How ?”<br>
I would say the answer fits two points :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Give power back to the user.</strong> It doesn’t mean that tech world mustn’t be unusable without a big time of learning, it means that tech should give all the keys to it’s own modification, not only by being Libre, but also by explaining the way it works to users, which joins the other point :</li>
<li>
<strong>Educate.</strong> People don’t know how to use tech because no one told them if they didn’t specifically took courses themselves. Knowing how your OS, how Internet works, at a basic level, should be in all tutorials, and how-to-use-this-thing parts.</li>
</ol>
<p>And you know what ? It won’t work. Peoples don’t want to be free, they don’t want to understand how this little plastic packed computer in their pockets every day works, they it to work, and they want to be enslaved by the rush of dopamine they get every time they open a notification.<br>
Try to talk to someone not already into computers about free software, and see the way they ditch the subject or look at you like you are an alien. We are still weird, and nobody cares about our voice.</p>
<p>Aldous Huxley is said to have said that “A really efficient totalitarian state would be one in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude.”</p>
<p>The FAANGS are this efficient totalitarian system, and you can’t change it because no one cares.</p>
<p>If you have any plans to change this state of fact, I would love to hear it, but I really doubt it will change my mind, let alone the world.</p>

            <h1>We, the Ones who Rule the World: A new manifest by Thirsty-Robot</h1>
<br>
We all know that the world has changed. Things aren’t the same as they were 20 years ago. And mostly in a field of study so vast as computer science or security. New individual are coming to the field every day; “How are websites made?”, “Why do I have internet”, the questions we’ve all asked, and the ones that other generations will ask too. Computers have grow smaller, thinner, more complex, and even amusing. New generations don’t have the tools to explore this, not because they don’t want to, but because companies don’t let them. If you have an Iphone, go ahead and look at it, do you see any screws, do you even see a lid that can be open, besides the SD and SIM compartment? The answer is a big well-deserved NO. It’s almost as it was planned.
<p>The world has changed and not for good. Everything is connected, everyone can know who you are on a simple Facebook or Google search (assuming that you use this services). Yes, you can change the default configuration, but how is a kid going to know this if he has never seen how his father opens the cover of his phone to get the battery out. For the new generations it just works and that’s it. New generation are not aware of how their data is being manipulated, how every stroke, every character they type is monitored, they were borned in a giant role-play of 1984.</p>
<p>We as hackers need to change this. We need to share with new generations, we need to make open-source projects “meta”. We, more than most individuals have the potential to change the modern world. We understand how it works, we understand on what it is based. As you read this, your government is maybe fighting a hacker, or other global powers on the internet. Computers are everything. There is not Illuminati, there is not “giant see it all eye”, there is only us. The guy who helped the teacher with her or his computer, the guy who made a pirate radio for fun, the guy who eats books on every subject, the guy that it’s full of curiosity, the guy that wanted to hack his favorite game to buy an item.</p>
<p>We are the ones that created the systems which makes our lives so easy. We are the cool guys now, we are not weird anymore, we have a voice, we are something. Correction we are everything.</p>
<p>We, are the ones who rule the world, let’s show them…</p>
