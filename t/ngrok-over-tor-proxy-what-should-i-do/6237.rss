    <title>Ngrok over TOR proxy.... What should I do?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/ngrok-over-tor-proxy-what-should-i-do/6237</link>
    <description>Hello 0x00SEC :D 
** please NOTE that is COMPLETELY educational **
in a previous question I asked here ( named: python reverse shell [0] ) , I was asking about how do I cover my connection so that if the victim was smart and opened wireshark as example, he won&#39;t be able to know my ip 

A comment on this topic suggested using NGROK[1] and another comment suggested using it over TOR. Thus I went to TAILS OS such that I can hide my ip from NGROK servers, here is what did:

0- I tried it directly (Without anything, on windows, with my ip ) to check if I am using it the right way or not, and I was using it right :D 

1- I next went to TAILS, made my adjustments for ngrok(connecting to my accout,...etc) then tried the following : 
   ` torify ./ngrok tcp 4000`
torify means that the next script,...etc will be directed though TOR ,tcp is the tunnel connection type and 4000 is the port no. My code listens to

2- The problem was that NGROK didn&#39;t connect :( 

In theory, as I thought, NGROK will connect and connection from client will be directed through it to Tor exit node , through nodes , till reaches me
and if I torrified my server, the same but in opposite direction [2]
IS there anything wrong in my setup, theory or even anything I didn&#39;t took it into considerations?

Thank&#39;s in advance.

[1] NGROK : https://ngrok.com
[2] As I mentioned in no.0, I have tested this but away from TOR and tails with my partner in this project, what I am not sure of is the case when using TOR.</description>

            <p>What application are you ngrok’ing? If it’s a web application, then use <code>ngrok http &lt;port number&gt;</code>. If it is not a web application use <code>tcp</code>, <code>ngrok tcp &lt;port number&gt;</code>.</p>

            <p>There is another problem I preferred to put it in a separate reply.</p>
<p>My server was listening to port 4000, and Ngrok directs anything coming to its server at port number x to my local machine at port 4000 ( That’s how I understand it )<br>
Now, I was testing in my main os (windows) and tails VM. when no server, client catches a connection ! and go crazy <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> although no server to listen to it !<br>
am I missing something  ?</p>
<p>When tried between server and client running on the main OS, the problem took place to, except that server accepts connection when run first…<br>
I put this in a separate reply as I think this is not related to Tails</p>

            <p>Finally I reached something important and got it to work <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Next I read a bit through the docs of ngrok and figured out they actually have a configuration option for SOCKS5 Proxies so I set that to socks5_proxy: “socks5://localhost:9050” which is tors default port for that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>First I don’t know how it worked and thus I may have miss-understand for if really Tails flows all traffic through tor or not.</p>
<p>The solution was in the previous quote, I put :<br>
<code>./ngrok tcp -config=./ngrok.yml 8920</code><br>
8920 is example of port number and “ngrok.yml” is a config file contains account token from ngrok and ( The important part) the argument <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/leeky">@Leeky</a> mentioned, socks proxy option in ngrok ( not tails )</p>
<p>This way, everything worked well and ngrok finally connected.<br>
This confuses me a bit, why torify didn’t do the job ? I have no answer</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/blacksteelcannon">@BlackSteelCannon</a> oh I didn’t try this on Tails, I just assumed that it would run there as well.<br>
I used a <a href="https://www.whonix.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Whonix</a> VirtualBox VM installation for my second try that routed all traffic through tor.<br>
The initial test that with torify and the ngrok configuration was done on a plain Ubuntu VM.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/leeky">@Leeky</a> Good to here this <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> ,<br>
Can you tell me the setting of your (Tails) you used (i.e : Vm or on live usb, ngrok was on persistent volume, … etc )</p>
<p>I tried what you tried in my VM and no success. This makes me think again that it is something related to permissions and VM or something like this.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I don’t know the internals of ngrok enough to know if this is a good idea.<br>
But anyways, I tried a bit around with it and got it a working connection through <code>torify ./ngrok http 80</code> I would assume connecting through tcp would work as well?<br>
I’m a bit confused by that.</p>
<p>Next I read a bit through the <a href="https://ngrok.com/docs" rel="nofollow noopener">docs</a> of ngrok and figured out they actually have a configuration option for SOCKS5 Proxies so I set that to <code>socks5_proxy: "socks5://localhost:9050"</code> which is tors default port for that.</p>
<p>I then tried to connect with <code>./ngrok http -config=./ngrok.yml 80</code> (again I only tested http) and checked with Wireshark and nyx if it’s actually connecting through tor which appears to be true (well it’s sending something through tor but that might just be a keep alive and not the actual connection).</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Just tested it <code>./ngrok http 80</code> on my Whonix Box as well and it works as well.<br>
Tails redirects all trafic through tor as well doesn’t it? if yes you should be able to run the command without torify.</p>
<p>I’m very sorry if this doesn’t actually work for tcp and I can also not guarantee that this doesn’t leak your real ip either. I’m not too good with this stuff <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>

            <p>Have you had a look at ToR’s <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation.html.en" rel="nofollow noopener">documentation</a>? I personally think your answer lies in the design of ToR itself, but this may or may not help you. I also feel like there is a piece missing here… or is that just me?</p>

<p>Did you try running ngrok without proxychains? Should work if tails automatically routes everything through tor.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As I mentioned, I used a simple python script to check, when I ran it without (torify) , connection was refused. using torify, Script returned IP of tor exit node ( Thus, I think it stops some connections unless torified)<br>
Doing the same with ngrok ( i.e:using Torify) , I got the error I mentioned in my previous comment ( I ran it with torrify not proxychains, no command proxychanis is known in tails ).</p>

Do you have any ideas ?</p>

            <p>Finally, a one done it before <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> you are the second one on the internet to mention this (after a one in reddit without having any answer <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> )</p>
<p>First, my setting and setup :<br>
I use tails on VM ( I know the drawbacks of this ) for testing the concept and get it working and till I buy another USB stick <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"><br>
I adjusted the bridges, and got tor working on them</p>
<p>Second, Torify :<br>
I have tested torify with a simple python code that returns my public ip, and it returned ip of tor exit node not mine.<br>
I also ran the token of ngrok with it and no problems, here is the response on torify (curl <a href="http://google.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">google.com</a> )<br>
<img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/4f534f151d3f888b2a2e04308029b7c28d8d1041.PNG" alt="Capture" data-base62-sha1="bjKcWdMzrLUiQn1XIhEP6gU34fD" width="690" height="95"></p>
<p>I tried to use proxychains but it says (<br>
command not found )</p>
<p>Finally , the error which appears on using torify to connect to ngrok<br>
( reconnecting + rotating between the next 3 errors in red color)</p>
<pre><code>reconnecting (dial tcp 18.216.22.45:443: getsockopt: connection refused) 
reconnecting (Get https://dns.google.com/resolve?cd=true&amp;name=tunnel.us.ngrok.com&amp;type=A: dial tcp 216.58.212.174:443: getsockopt: connection refused)

</code></pre>
<p>I hope this is can be solved <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>My idea for malware would be to request a bit.ly link which gets forwarded to a pastebin containing the updated ngrok server. That way you could dynamically change ngrok endpoints, and yet you could update it using bit.ly and pastebin.</p>
<p>I’m sure a framework is begging to be made here.</p>

            <p>Yo. I’ve done this many times before, tor and ngrok together is a dangerously cool combo, and it works really well too.</p>
<p>I used proxychains. And ran:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">proxychains ngrok tcp 4444
</code></pre>
<p>It then gives me a ngrok service that I can connect to. Can you verify torify is working? Is tor available? Attempt this and tell me the result:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">torify curl google.com
</code></pre>

            <p>You are right, but installing TOR at victim’s side is a pain.</p>
<p>I was trying to do something which gives the same result (anonymous link to the victim) but away from installing TOR at victim’s side</p>
<p>1- I buy a domain (using TOR) from NGROK<br>
2- Hardcode it in the victim code<br>
3- Run NGROK on my TailsOS so I will be anonymous from NGROK servers</p>

            <p>I’m slightly confused and here’s a quick thought… I remember somewhere that WannaCrypt used ToR in order to say anonymous… Is that what you’re trying to accomplish?</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I don’t really understand the problem, so please elaborate. The VPS has a static ip which you should hardcode in the client. You only connect to the VPS via SSH and run the handler there.</p>
<p>Best, SmartOne</p>

            <p>This solves my problem by makes another one <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
I mean , both Ngrok ( paid plan ) and Tor hidden service provide me a static ip that I can hard-code it in my backdoor to the victim.<br>
Your solution requires the backdoor the get the ip I am working now on every time my server disconnects, which is not proper solution</p>
<p>UNLESS you have an idea to overcome this I will be happy <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>That’s the hard part. You can compile a static, dependency-free tor executable which might be difficult. A quick google search yielded <a href="https://github.com/cretz/rtsw-poc" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>, could be a good place to start. After you get that onto the victim system, you’ll have to execute it and not get caught by AV. Afterwards, <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/716/how-to-connect-to-a-remote-socket-through-tor-in-python" rel="nofollow noopener">connect</a> through the SOCKS proxy it creates.</p>
