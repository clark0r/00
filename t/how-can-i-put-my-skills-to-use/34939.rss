    <title>How can I put my skills to use?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/how-can-i-put-my-skills-to-use/34939</link>
    <description>I&#39;m on my last school year, I haven&#39;t graduated yet. 

I know the fundamentals of Python and C/C++, Linux basics, Linux server management beginner knowledge, cybersecurity basics. I used to make basic tools which I would then sell to script kiddies, but I don&#39;t have the option to do it anymore.

I don&#39;t think I can find a job yet because I don&#39;t have any experience and nor have I graduated.

What are the things I can do to put the little experience I have to use?</description>
