    <title>So you want to learn assembly? Core War</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/so-you-want-to-learn-assembly-core-war/495</link>
    <description>Learning assembly takes a while, and it is a bit hard to jump straight into a modern processor and start coding... So, if you do not have any experience with the bare metal, it is good to start with a pretty simple assembly. And the simplest assembly I can recall is called RedCode 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War

Despite of being a fun game, it is a nice way to start with low level programming. The machine does not have registers or stack, just memory and some flags. The number of instructions is small (around 16, depending on the version you try) and only a couple of memory addressing modes are allowed. There are some kind of threading also.

Take a look to the wiki page (specially the part about the use of genetic algorithms to generate code :slight_smile:) 

And here is the simplest RedCode program you can write... The IMP

```
MOV 0, 1
```
Moves content of current memory cell (by default addressing is relative to the instruction pointer), into the next memory cell. When the IP is increased the same code is executed again and again...

Let me know when you are done with RedCode and we can move into the next level!

Happy Hacking!</description>

<p>It was exactly the same for me… that was my first real C program ever!!!. It would be awesome if you share it… mine I think is definitely lost and I’m scary to look again to that code <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>

            <p>Sorry for digging up such old topic but I would like to say that this project is awesome. I had the chance to develop it at the uni a long time ago and it’s a good way to challenge your skill in C and ASM. I will try to put my hand on it and share my work with you guys.</p>

            <p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Looks pretty similar to RedCode (the assembly I mean), so I would say that, from a learning point of view, it would be pretty similar. I like more the concept of having to programs fighting for resources in a computer that solving puzzle approach… But that is a completely person matter.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing.</p>

<p>Core War is a 1984 programming game created by D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney in which two or more battle programs (called "warriors") compete for control of a virtual computer. These battle programs are written in an abstract assembly language called Redcode.
 At the beginning of a game, each battle program is loaded into memory at a random location, after which each program executes one instruction in turn. The goal of the game is to cause the processes of opposing programs to terminate (which h...</p>
