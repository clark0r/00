    <title>Overlooked privesc on Sangoma Netborder device</title>

    <description>Hello 0x00sec,

here I&#39;d like to add a exploit that I happened to discover during my exploration of telco networks.

There is a known exploit for &quot;Sangoma SBC&quot;, that allows you to login into the web config with an universal username of 
    
    ha|echo

And any password (it&#39;s irrelevant).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can read about it here:
&lt;br&gt;

![image|690x439](upload://2eBN0Oo6uCRkfP7FVjmFewhUDLO.png) 

You then have root access to the configuration and could change or crash the whole system.

What wasn&#39;t mentioned in any of the articles I found, is the following:

If you go to to **&quot;Configuration&quot; --&gt; &quot;Command execution&quot;**
![image|690x234](upload://lxaPIIYDNc91LnHCY5qaDP7Khax.png) 

You will be seeing this screen. If you click on the &quot;Show Shell/NSG Commands&quot; it lists some four or five commands. Normally you&#39;d assume these are the commands you&#39;re able/allowed to use.

However, when you type in and execute

    whoami

then the output (it gives the results in html) is

    root

And voila, you just have a root shell (although it&#39;s a bit difficult to handle with the indirect html-output).

But you can send all commands and even access the juicy files and contents or set up a reverse shell.


Although I doubt that will be of use for anyone here, I thought I&#39;d just let you know.

Just in case :slight_smile:</description>
