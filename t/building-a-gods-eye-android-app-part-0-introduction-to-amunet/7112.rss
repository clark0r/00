    <title>Building a God&#39;s Eye Android App: Part 0 - Introduction to Amunet</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/building-a-gods-eye-android-app-part-0-introduction-to-amunet/7112</link>
    <description>Greetings from space,

It&#39;s great to post once in a while and help share knowledge. This series is an android series. We will develop spying features into our app. I&#39;m naming the app **AMUNET** but you are free to of course name it as you please. The idea originated from the God&#39;s Eye hacking program in Fast and Furious movie where it could locate and also hack into anything within its reach. In this series, we take a step by step in developing an android app that will use ( abuse ) android os functionalities to spy on the users and also maybe control the phone.

**DISCLAIMER**

I am by no means responsible for what you use the codes or knowledge learnt from this development series in any form. This series is purely an education series on the android system.

**WHAT THIS SERIES IS NOT**

* This series will not help or teach anyone how to deploy / hack into android phones to install the app. Since it&#39;s educational, you are required to test and use it on your own devices. The app will be uninstalled and installed repeatedly as new permissions and features are added so don&#39;t think this is a kali hacking android tutorial.

* The basic installation and setting up of Android Studio will not be covered. I assume you already have it installed and setup. If not, there are a lot more tutorials out there created about Android Studio installation than the total tutorials here combined ( :thinking: )

**INTRODUCTION TO AMUNET**

There is no finished android app or source code that I&#39;ll be looking upon to build this series so I don&#39;t expect anyone to pm asking for source code for the entire series. In fact, this app doesn&#39;t exist yet and we will all together develop it. Therefore, at the end of every post, you are allowed to share opinions, corrections and even better code improvement since I don&#39;t know it all and eager to learn ( began android dev not long ago ). 

**INTERNALS OF AMUNET**

![gods%20eye|690x459](upload://hBp5ylka3tv57AIih9F7fbiR48Q.jpg)

The app will communicate to an external server where all the information gathered will be sent. We will develop both Web UI ( HTML CSS Bootstrap, Javascript ) and Android ( Java ) UI so it&#39;s going to be a very long series.

So I will end it here. This post is just to create awareness of the upcoming posts. I will like to have your votes, comments, opinions and how you think the app should look like, structure and communication techniques.
