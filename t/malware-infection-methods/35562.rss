    <title>Malware infection methods</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/malware-infection-methods/35562</link>
    <description>Hello! 

Recently I started to study and understand the methods of infecting other files with viruses. And the first thing I started with was the injection into the space between the beginning of the code and the end of the section table. 

But every time I tried to inject the code, the program didn&#39;t want to run, giving me an error (0xc000007b). 
I assume that this is because Windows does not like the AddressOfEntryPoint, which is indicated just in this place. Is this really the issue or am I missing something?</description>
