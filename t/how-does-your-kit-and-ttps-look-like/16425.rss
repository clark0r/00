    <title>How does your kit and TTPs look like?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/how-does-your-kit-and-ttps-look-like/16425</link>
    <description>All,

Question: How does your kit and TTPs look like when you are defending/ offensive in the cyber domain? I am looking for feedback mainly from those who serve in a operation manager/ Red Team Leader type of role, however, I appreciate anyone who would like to offer their advice

I am looking at designing my own specific toolkit and TTPs for long term cyber security operations. 

My background: I am a CS major; combat arms military and I am looking at starting a career in cyber security (red teaming). My interests include but not limited to: physical security (social engineering), network security, mobile security, and coding in Russian. Currently in my kitbag are (my methodology is F3EAD but I shorten it to F3E^2):
Find: 
1. HUMINT - the dictionary of body language by joe navarro, and the social engineer&#39;s playbook, a practical guide to pretexting.
2. OSINT - Maltego, 
3. Others - Netcat, Nmap, WireShark, SN1PER
Fix: 
1. Metasploit 
Finish: 
1. John the Ripper 
2. THC Hydra 
3. Aircrack-ng
Exploit: 
*blank*
Post-Exploit: 
*blank*

I left the above blank as I would like to see what others think. Stay frosty mates,
