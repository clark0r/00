    <description>Hey good peeps,

I would like to start a thread on your favorite hacking books. Ones you read recently and taught you one or two new tricks, or ones that you read a decade ago and literally changed your way of thinking about hacking!!
I realize there are a lot of &quot;how to hack facebook&quot; shenanigans going on here, so hopefully such a thread will help set people on the right path to hacking...
Allow me to start first :

**Books of old that shaped my hacking career (a bit outdated now but still great):**
* The Art of Intrusion - The Real Stories Behind the Exploits of Hackers, Intruders and Deceivers , Kevin Mitnick
* Counter Hack Reloaded - A Step-by-Step Guide to Computer Attacks and Effective Defenses, Ed Skoudis

**Books that rocked my life recently:**
* [How to Hack Like a Legend - A hacker’s tale breaking into a secretive offshore company , Sparc Flow](https://amzn.to/2uWh1Up)
* [The Art of Memory Forensics - Detecting Malware and Threats in Windows, Linux, and Mac Memory](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Memory-Forensics-Detecting-Malware/dp/1118825098/)

Your turn :slight_smile:</description>
