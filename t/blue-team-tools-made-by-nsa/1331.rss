    <title>Blue Team Tools - made by NSA</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/blue-team-tools-made-by-nsa/1331</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

a few days ago, I found [this](https://github.com/iadgov) on GitHub. These are &quot;Information Assurance&quot; tools made by the NSA.
Most of them are about attack mitigation, but I REALLY don&#39;t trust this. I haven&#39;t read the complete source code yet, but I wonder why the NSA would share tools that could help to keep them out of one&#39;s system.  Maybe I&#39;m just paranoid.

Anyway, I thought some of you might be interested in it, so here it is.

            <p>Yes, it’s official. I think they stated it was a reaction on the ShadowBrokers, they wanted to be more transparent to regain some public trust. Didn’t work on me, but it’s still nice to see some NSA-grade sourcecode.</p>

            <p>I’m suspicious of this. Why would the NSA release their tools unless of course this is part of a grand plan to catch hackers. Wouldn’t be surprised.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
