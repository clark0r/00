    <description>Hi everyone!!

Been a little quiet for a while, but I&#39;ve been grinding on this Red Team stuff, recently got an amazing certificate from HackTheBox on Red Team, and of course working on more! I haven&#39;t forgotten about our beginner security engineers trying to jump on red teaming, so I&#39;ve built the RedTeamNotes 2.0 for everyone to see, and understand how the red team techniques work at a very high level but now, what about setting up infrastructure from 0 to hero. Well I&#39;ve taken care of that, and of course, all the tools utilized are open source as always, and do have fun learning and practicing. Don&#39;t be afraid to reach out, maybe I misspelled or got something wrong.

I will be updating the book more, more techniques, tips, and tricks.

Please enjoy!
