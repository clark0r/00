    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/cs-advanced-chatserver/4871</link>
    <description>Soo... iv been a good little network programmer and have made a new version of a ChatServer with multisocket support. This one works much better then my last. So far it isnt encrypted but ... im too lazy to add that now and i still have to add a config to it, So ye... it isnt done but the idea is there and i hope you guys can learn a few tips on how to create more advanced Servers in c#.

This will compile on both Linux (mono) an Windows and run on both so ye Dubble wammy!

            <p>You should put this on github. That way everyone can view the code without being required to download it first. Nothing against you, but this is the internet after all.</p>
