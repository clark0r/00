    <title>Encryption application in the works. (FOSS or no?)</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/encryption-application-in-the-works-foss-or-no/18700</link>
    <description>Hello 0x00sec!

mrQaz here. You dont know me but I was here before 90% of you.  I know pry0cc will enjoy my small contribution and as so I also should contribute.anyways.

I have developed a very small and simple encryption app which at the moment encrypts a given input. However, if anyone would be interested, I would maybe consider making it more advanced and essentially uploading the source code to github or something for people to use. 

let me know if you would be interested.
