    <title>AMD or Intel for RE?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/amd-or-intel-for-re/10586</link>
    <description>I am looking to update my rig. 
My current system is a 1st generation Core-i7 desktop from 2010. It&#39;s fairly old and runs into a few problems here and there and that&#39;s why I decide to upgrade.

I am undecided on what system to get Intel or AMD. 
If I go the AMD way I gonna choose the Ryzen 2700X which looks to be a good processor. Nothing yet decided on the Intel side.

I am a Reverse Engineer by profession. So I do need to run a lot of VM&#39;s. 

Both Intel and AMD support hardware virtualization but the point is Intel VT-x looks to be better supported. Same for Nested Virtualization (EPT/SLAT). For example, all the related projects below on GitHub only support VT-X and not AMD-V

https://github.com/tandasat/HyperPlatform
https://github.com/ionescu007/SimpleVisor
https://github.com/wbenny/hvpp
https://github.com/Bareflank/hypervisor

Similarly, Intel Processors support a feature known as [Processor Tracing](https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/09/18/processor-tracing) which does not have an AMD equivalent. Without PT support, Ultimap 2 in CheatEngine won&#39;t work.

I would definitely want to get the 2700X as it provides better value but the above mentioned limitations are holding me back.

I would like to know the opinions of the members of this forum as to which they prefer AMD or Intel for RE tasks.</description>
