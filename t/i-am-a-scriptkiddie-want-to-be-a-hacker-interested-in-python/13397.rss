            <p>Hello <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/axom_hexor">@axom_hexor</a>. Personally, I think Python is a great choice. Not only it is extremely popular in infosec, but it is also very easy to learn. If I were you, I would start by reading the official tutorial at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html</a> and then either get a book like the ones mentioned above or take a python for ethical hackers course.</p>
<p>Whatever you decide to do, make sure the book/course you pick teaches Python 3, or you will be in big troubles when Python 2 is retired at the end of this year. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
gnix</p>
