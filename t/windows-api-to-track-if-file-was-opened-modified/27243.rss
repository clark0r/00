    <title>Windows API to track if file was opened/modified?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/windows-api-to-track-if-file-was-opened-modified/27243</link>
    <description>I am using file auditing to track if a particular file was opened/modified (4663 Event).

I get more information, about which process was used to access the file eg: notepad.exe etc.

Is there any other Windows API/function I can use to do a similar thing?</description>
