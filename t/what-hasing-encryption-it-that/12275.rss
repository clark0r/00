    <title>What hasing/encryption it that?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/what-hasing-encryption-it-that/12275</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,

I have two salted passwords that are hashed or encrypted. However, I have no clue how they were encrypted/hashed.

Maybe someone here knows better:

    root:$1$Qs0GDsVl$dG7JZYQ5RwWpuZ0usjC0C1

    toor:$1$NY80/5UC$xw8.4bLJ8X1ffFRU7qiHq/


They are from a RHEL /etc/shadow (version from 2014 I think).

Both &quot;hashes&quot; are 22 characters, salt 8 characters.

Ideas or knowledge very much appreciated!

Sincerely yours...</description>

            <p>Exactly. Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/shellcromancer">@Shellcromancer</a> for adding the resource.</p>
<p>I missed to put in the $1$ at the beginning which confused me --&gt; I opened this thread.</p>

            <p>The hashes in /etc/shadow can be idetified by the number between the $'s:</p>
<pre><code>$1$ – MD5crypt
$5$– SHA-256crypt
$6$ – SHA-512crypt
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s an article explaning the md5crypt algorithm: <a href="https://pthree.org/2015/08/07/md5crypt-explained/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://pthree.org/2015/08/07/md5crypt-explained/</a></p>
