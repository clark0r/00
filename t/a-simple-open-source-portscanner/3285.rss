    <title>A Simple Open Source Portscanner</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/a-simple-open-source-portscanner/3285</link>
    <description>Hello NullSec, Joker back with another tool that I wrote today. As the title says this is a portscanner that I&#39;ve decided to code to learn more about packets and how they work. This is a very simple program that basically does a SYN scan. Issue is that most systems would block this type of scan and therefore I recommend using nmap for testing and hacking purposes. This project is for educational purposes only. I should note that the [site](http://www.binarytides.com/tcp-connect-port-scanner-c-code-linux-sockets/) I used as reference honestly both has ugly code and I don&#39;t think the code works that well, but helped a lot with explaining to me how packets work at least for a SYN scan. 

A overview of a SYN scan is simple enough:
``
client ----- sends -----&gt; SYN ----- to -----&gt; server
``
``
server ----- sends ----&gt; SYN+ACK ----- to ------&gt; client
``
Simple? I think so. 

Anyways, the [code](https://gitlab.s-3.tech/v02alentine/portscanner) is simple enough to compile and use. I&#39;ve as usual added comments to help those who wish to look at my code to understand how it works-ish...

I&#39;m gonna be working on different types of scans like FIN scan and others in the future. 

Welp that&#39;s it for now, cheers!</description>
