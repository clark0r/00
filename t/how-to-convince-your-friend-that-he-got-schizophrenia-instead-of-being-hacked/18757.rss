    <title>How to convince your friend that he got Schizophrenia instead of being hacked?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/how-to-convince-your-friend-that-he-got-schizophrenia-instead-of-being-hacked/18757</link>
    <description>One of my classmates continuously sends me some screenshots which he believes is the proof of his phone being hacked, and he insists that his life is under surveillance by a hacker. I have looked through those screenshots and his phone and it turns out nothing wrong. From his way of talk and facial expression I suppose that he got Schizophrenia and got a victimization delusion. How should I convince him to go to the hospital?

Thank you for your reply.<br>
In fact I have tried to do this for a couple of days, but it seems like he is unwilling to analyze the result and insists his opinion. Maybe I should communicate with his parents about this issue.</p>
