    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/i-broke-my-msfconsole-help/1757</link>
    <description>I am lost guys as what to do,  i broke my metasploit trying to install a tool, i figured out the correct way to install but now when i try and get my msfconsole up it gives me a huge error message.  

all i want to do is remove metasploit and then bring it back as a fresh install and i am lost as how to correctly do it.  can anyone help  me?  

this is the error i am getting, not that it matters because i just want to reset, but ill put it here just in case.

            <ol>
<li>Make sure you’re running the latest version of Kali.</li>
<li>Make sure you start the postgresql service before starting metasploit. (though, iirc, this shouldn’t stop your from using msfconsole, and postgresql not running will just disable database capabilities.)</li>
<li>See if this helps your situation:<br>
<code>chown -R /usr/share/metasploit</code><br>
<code>apt-get install ruby-dev</code><br>
I think you’re missing out on permissions, though root should always be able to access them, its worth a try</li>
<li>RVM is not really needed unless you’re working with two or more ruby versions together simultaneously. A regular ruby install or as provided by your distro packagers should be alright. Though, it has always made things easier than difficult.</li>
<li>If nothing works, try removing metasploit and then reinstalling it.</li>
</ol>

            <p>Indeed, Kali can be rough. In fact, I recently broke my apt install and it took me a couple of days to figure out that I had somehow “upgraded” to the apt:i386 version which doesn’t work on my setup just yet. (I know, shoot me dead for not making it multi arch. as soon as I installed.)<br>
Also, <em><strong>Ubuntu</strong></em>??? As opposed to masterrace <em><strong>Debian Linux</strong></em>??? <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"><img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"> <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/i-broke-my-msfconsole-help/1757/4">spoiler</a></span></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/bugsy">@Bugsy</a><br>
<strong><em>As for msfconsole, you’re gonna want to try this:</em></strong><br>
apt-get reinstall metasploit-framework metasploit-common msfpc ruby-msfrpc-client</p>
<p><strong><em>If that didn’t work, try this:</em></strong><br>
apt-get remove metasploit-framework metasploit-common msfpc ruby-msfrpc-client</p>
<p>and then:</p>
<p>apt-get install metasploit-framework metasploit-common msfpc ruby-msfrpc-client</p>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not 100% absolutely sure that this will work, but it’s the best solution I can come up with if you really <em>must</em> stick with Kali. Following with what <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a> said, Make sure your ruby version is compatible with your Metasploit version as well.</p>

            <p>So I see you’re using Kali…</p>
<p>Metasploit is a really tough one. I would recommend ditching Kali, booting up a fresh copy of Ubuntu, installing rvm, and installing all from fresh. Kali is an absolute nightmare with fixing anything or modification, perhaps reinstall Kali?</p>
<p>You’ll probably find the issue you’re having is due to either due to dependencies, or the version of ruby you’re using. Again. RVM fixes this issue.</p>
<p>Can you update msfconsole with msfupdate and report back?</p>
