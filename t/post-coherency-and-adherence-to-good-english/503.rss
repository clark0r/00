    <description># Post Coherency and Adherence to Good English

Hey, everyone! I thought I&#39;d take just a little time to talk about how posts should be written.

----
#Formatting

Formatting should follow something like posts by @dtm or me (@oaktree).

* [Example 1 by dtm](https://0x00sec.org/t/pe-file-infection/401) 
* [Example 2 by me](https://0x00sec.org/t/graph-algorithms-part-1-0-dijkstras-shortest-path-concept/419)

I would advise that you learn some basic Markdown syntax before posting. Alternatively, the editor comes with some clickables that&#39;ll drop in the formatting for you. (See the __B__ and _I_ buttons?)

----

# Grammar

Not everyone has perfect grammar, and that&#39;s alright. However, all contributors should keep in mind that part of making a thorough, readable, and understandable post is maintaining good grammar practices and using English properly.

I&#39;m not saying that you should _never_ end a sentence with a preposition on here, but make your writing understandable.

----

# Word Choice

Another part of writing good posts is word choice. You shouldn&#39;t be too repetitive or redundant. Avoid recursive definitions when trying to describe something. An example of a recursive definition is:

&gt; Suing is when you sue somebody.

Also, posters should avoid repeating words too often:

&gt; Now that we have done this, now we will do this.

Did you notice the repetitions of &quot;now&quot; and &quot;this&quot;?

&gt; Now that we have done this, let&#39;s do something else.

Oh, wow! That&#39;s so much better. All you really have to do is think a little bit longer before you type.

----

# Proof-Reading

___Always read over what you&#39;ve written.___

Things to look for include:

* __Spelling, Grammar, Capitalization, and Punctuation__
* __Language Semantics__: Does what you wrote convey the meaning you intended?
* __Formatting__: Can a reader follow this? Are my paragraphs too long? Make sure you split things up into paragraphs. For procedures, use ordered lists.
* __Spelling, Grammar, Capitalization, and Punctuation__: Yes, I put this one twice. It&#39;s important! Even if you&#39;re not a native English speaker, you have access to spellcheck and [Google](https://google.com/)!

# Conclusion

This post was just a little advice relating to _how_ articles should be written. If you&#39;ve noticed, I may have edited a post of yours and cited &quot;spelling, grammar, and formatting&quot; as the reason. I usually will not do this, but if I feel like the post is just below &quot;understandable,&quot; I&#39;ll make a few changes to it.</description>
