            <p>Check the system you compromised for tools like wget, curl, ftp, ssh, etc. All these can be used to download files and look less suspicious than meterpreter traffic. Of course if you want to download files to the database that could still look suspicious, since DBs don’t usually download things xD. I’d say monitor network traffic on the DB and see what’s “normal” for it and try to go along those lines with downloading files.</p>
