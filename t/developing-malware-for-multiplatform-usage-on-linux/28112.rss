    <title>Developing Malware for multiplatform usage on linux</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/developing-malware-for-multiplatform-usage-on-linux/28112</link>
    <description>First off id like to say really dig all the info this forum has to offer, it truly has been a plethora of knowledge for me on my quest to destruction. 

However I keep running into this same roadblock down many of my turns when developing with python and it is that how do I write python malware for windows while developing on linux? I keep seeing these different modules such as win32con, win32api, winreg, etc however when I try a pip  install they are no where to be found. 

I could just go about my business and develope in GoLang since it&#39;s already all nice and ready to fuck up mr bill gates, but seriously....

Can someone steer me in the right direction as far as developing in python goes?

Thanks again yall,


Ebro.</description>
