    <title>HackTheBox Weekly Challenge - LaCasaDePapel</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/hackthebox-weekly-challenge-lacasadepapel/12679</link>
    <description>Hi 0x00ers! 

For this fine week, as the first week of April, we&#39;re going to be jumping into LaCasaDePapel! On first look this seems like it&#39;s going to be a creative foothold (but who knows).

This is rated easy, so it should be quite straightforward, remember not to overthink it and enumerate EVERYTHING. 

When you manage to get user and root this one, please drop a comment on your thoughts, whether you liked it or not, whether your not you&#39;ve learned anything on this. These kinds of experiences are so helpful for newbies getting into HackTheBox for the first time, and comments like these helped me when I started out!

If you&#39;re timing yourself, feel free to post your timings. I never time myself but I know some like to.

## Box Info
This is a Linux box and is rated easy, I spent 10 minutes enumerating this the other day before getting pulled away, and looks like it&#39;s going to be a fun, themed box. We&#39;ll have to wait and see.

OS: Linux

Release Date: 30 Mar 2019
