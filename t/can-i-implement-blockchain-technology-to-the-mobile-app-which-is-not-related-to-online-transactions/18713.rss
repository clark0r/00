    <description>Hi brothers,
I have a question relating to Blockchain technology. The question is, **Can I implement blockchain technology to the mobile app which is not related to online transactions?** :slightly_smiling_face:
Because I have an idea to develop an app with ML object recognition, top of blockchain technology (for a secure data transmission between the app and AWS).

**&gt; Is this possible?** :slightly_smiling_face:</description>
