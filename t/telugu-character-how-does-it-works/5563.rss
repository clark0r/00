    <description>#Telugu
Hi, so I think all in here are aware of the telugu char, the one that crashes apple devices. Most of my friends own Iphone and they have received this character, and they&#39;ve come to me for a solution. I have spend 1 complete day answering my friend&#39;s cry for help, between all this helping I wonder, how can a character crash a phone almost at the point when it doesn&#39;t turns on?</description>
