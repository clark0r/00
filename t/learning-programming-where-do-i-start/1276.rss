    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/learning-programming-where-do-i-start/1276</link>
    <description>Hey

I had last a discussion on the IRC but now that im thinking clearly its better to learn a programming language.:P
so my question is where can i learn it. well what i mean is i would love to learn python very good but the problem is i don&#39;t know where to start yes i know i need to start with the basics.but I want to start on small projects and learn from them. And what is the best OS to learn python is it Linux or is windows better i love to work on Linux if it go&#39;s about programming. But windows i have allot experience with it :P

thanks, allot

PS.love this community</description>

            <p>Hey Appie35!</p>
<p>I’m also attempting to learn to code on my own to hopefully move from a IT help desk position to a junior dev in the company I work for.  This is what I’ve currently been up too:</p>
<p>Right now I’m working through “python crash course” by starchpress (have the pdf if you want it, don’t spend money on the book) and found it super helpful, I plan on reading any python book I can get a hold of as I learn best through repetition and learning from different sources is helpful to me.</p>
<p>I also keep a pocket notebook to jot down ideas for programs I want to build. I found that if WANT to build something I’m more likely to get in front of my pc and actually do it  with the help of stack overflow and other communities.</p>
<p>Thats what I’m currently doing until I feel good enough to build a program and feel like I can use it as a resume project.</p>
<p>Also running Parrot OS as a daily driver, with Geanny IDE because I like the look and feel, I installed it over windows after test driving it in a VM to force myself to learn linux kind of lol. Use whatever your comfortable with IDE’s run on every OS.</p>
<p>//Just realized this post is from 2 years ago… I’m obviously new here…</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>This guide is based on my own experience and opinions.</p>
<p>First you need to ask yourself is programming something that you want to do for the rest of your life as a hobby or profession or it’s just a thing that you like to see how it works. If programming is just a thing that you like to see how it works then I suggest you to start with web basics: HTML and CSS markup (not programming) languages. By learning this stuff you will get the picture on how web browsers renders html documents retrieved from web server. Don’t lose more then 3 days on this stuff. After that, start with Python to get a picture on how programming languages works. You can find a lot of beginner tutorials for Python online.  Program in Python no more than 4 days to get the global picture on how programming languages works, and then forget about programming, programming languages, loops and everything else that you read in last seven days. Call your friends, go grab a beer with them and move on to chasing career in some other field that you are interested in.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about programming on long term period then I suggest you to start with mother of all programming languages: C programming language. Why C language? There is a multiple reasons to start with C. First of all, C influenced almost all “modern” programming languages and most of them borrowed some syntax from C. Kernels of Linux, Windows and Mac operating systems are also developed in C. Probably your dad’s Toyota Prius has thousand and thousand lines of code in C. Most of embedded systems are programmed in C.<br>
Starting to programming in C won’t be easy at all. But you need to be diligent and persistent. Programming is something that you learn in 10 years long term. You must be aware of that. You cannot became a decent programmer in 24 hours or 7 days. It’s a long and fu**ed up path.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Beginner<br>
I suggest you to first install Linux (preferably Ubuntu or Mint distro) on your programming machine. Using Linux from the start you will also learn a lot about operating systems, how they work, and you will get yours hands dirty on command line. As a programmer, command line will become your living room, bedroom and toilet. With Linux you will get gcc (C compiler) and TextEditor. That’s all what you need to start programming in C. For the book I suggest you “The C Programming Language,  2nd Edition”. In this phase of learning your main focus will be on data types, operators and expressions. You’ll learn what is compiling, what is main method, what are function arguments and what is procedural programming. After that you will learn about control flow statements and loops. Then you’ll proceed with functions, programming structure, arrays and pointers, structs, I/O, handling memory and a lot more. This all are programming basics and the more time you spend learning basics, you will later build your advanced knowledge much easier . Don’t just read the book, write every example from the book, compile and figure out every line of code. After your finish the book (and all that stuff will be probably very boring to you) you will get rock solid basics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enthusiast<br>
Now it’s time to go from procedural programming to object oriented programming. Move on to C++ programming language. Find some decent book (probably “C++ Demystified”) and learn C++ syntax and basic. You will catch up fast because you have knowledge of C. In this phase of learning your focus will be on objects and classes and OOP in general. You will need to learn difference between pointer and reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Padawan<br>
Now you have experience in two (most used) programming languages. Now you need to learn to be more effective with less lines of code. I suggest you to start with some book about data structures and algorithms (maybe “Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, 3rd Edition”). In this phase of learning you will learn what are lists, stacks, queues, trees and heap, what is sorting etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After you finish all this steps, you will have decent amount of knowledge to start building simple software. Now you need to decide will you move on to web programming (PHP, C#, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS), embedded programming (C, C++, assembly language) or mobile development (Java, Objective C, Swift, etc.). All this fields have different learning paths but you will have strong basics and you will progress fast.</p>

            <p>hi every1, am in the same situation. i dnt know where to START, i dnt know anything about coding, about Logic or About Algorithm but realy i love this shit… so help me to find out the best way to start… 1 year ago i was just having fun with Android Apps, SystemUi and Framwork modding (Small things) so when my Status bar got transparent my love with Coding Started… now i want to learn from the root not only modifications, i want to build something by my own, i want to do things like Elliote on Mr. Robot <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"> <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=9" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"> Just to figure Out… ah i have tried Linux based systems (Ubuntu, Elementary Os) and i liked it, but now am using Win10.<br>
And so for my bad English<br>
Thank You</p>

            <p>First of all thanks everyone who has replied on this.<br>
Well language that im learning is python it seems that I like it. I follow the tuts of sentdex and make with the help of that. i learn to make my own variables <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
so yeah thanks for all your replies BTW i don’t even know what a 1337 is i will search it up but still thanks everyone <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Pick a language (good options are C, C++, C#, Java, JS, Ruby, Python, Haskell, Go, Rust, Crystal, Erlang – ya got me: I’m listing all of them).</p>
<p>There is no one language that will allow you to master programming; rather, to master programming, you must transcend language itself.</p>
<p>However, mastering at least <em>one</em> language is undoubtedly a great way to start. Ask yourself: <em>What interests you more: the nitty-gritty, or getting the job done?</em> Languages tend to favor one side or the other.</p>
<p>Once you’ve picked your language, get comfortable with it. Implement a few algorithms (sorting, search, ciphers). Familiarize yourself with your language’s standard library. Reimplement that standard library – the fun parts, at least.</p>
<hr>
<p>You’ve gone this far. You have a grasp of at least one programming language. Now it’s time to learn another programming language, its internals, its libraries, how to write pretty, language-specific code…</p>
<p>You should be approaching the point where you’re thinking less about code and more about <strong>what code means</strong>. Understanding a program’s logic is really important.</p>
<hr>
<h3>10,000 Hours</h3>
<p>Getting good at programming takes a lot of time. It will not be easy. I advocate the 10k hours rule (this is about 5 years of a full-time job).</p>
<hr>
<h2>Wanna be 1337?</h2>
<p>If you want to be <strong>1337</strong>, as <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/_py">@_py</a> has suggested, then you must start at the bottom! You’ll need technical knowledge of your OS and how computers work.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/nitrax">@Nitrax</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/valentine">@Valentine</a>:  Trying to push someone to a specific direction based on your personal experience is not wise imo.</p>
<p>There is no “right” programming language for a starter. <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/appie35">@appie35</a>, your question has no correct answer. In the end, it’s all about which language “clicks” to you. You can be programming 24/7 in python without knowing about memory or C at all and still make a shitload of money and enjoy it at the same time and vice versa.  The big advantage of C is that it introduces you to an insane amount of aspects and fields of Computer Science which can take you to the next level. Most of the knowledge I have (even non-programming related) is thanks to C. On the other hand, you may not be the low-level guy who likes visualizing bits and bytes. Just play around with many languages and find the true bae. Who knows, you may be a future JavaScript ninja. Just don’t force yourself. It’ll be 100% frustrating trying to get to ACTUALLY know the language itself but that’s what makes it fun.</p>
<p>A great programmer should know both the high and low level view of his/her machine, keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Best of luck…</p>
<p>P.S Don’t you dare call yourself a 1337 programmer/hacker if you don’t know how memory works.</p>

            <p>Same here. I started from scratch also, but from my experiences it can be frustrating. I prefer C over all programming languages but I was introduced to coding through Java. It took me a while to understand the concepts 'cuz I was a skid (big time). In the end C is the best language to learn, but not at first. It maybe more flexible but it’s not user friendly. Unless you’re a genius or take a course in C, I still wouldn’t recommend it.</p>

            <p>Your position makes sense. However, I started from scratch as a self-learner without any knowledge in programmation and It was very rewarding. I maintain that mastering C affords more flexibility and a better understanding of the programming world .</p>
<p>Different methods ;). That is why computer science is so interesting.</p>

            <p>You have to disagree to agree.</p>
<p>I see your point of view, but I also disagree. It all depends on what one is interested in. I would recommend C, but python is more friendlier to beginners in my opinion. C is a lot more challenging to learn especially if you’re learning without any guidance by others. Of course that’s what this forum is about, to help one learn, but I still wouldn’t recommend C if you’re a absolute beginner. Just saying.</p>

            <p>Hi mate,</p>
<p>I will give you some advises based on my own experiences.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how to properly code, I advise you to start with C. It is, from my opinion, one of the most “difficult” languages. Indeed, you have to learn how to manage your memory and avoid unauthorized accesses, leaking, etc. It will help you to fully understand the interaction between your code base and your machine and acquire the methodology and the logic behind coding ! Indeed, once mastering C programmation, you will be able to code in other types of language, except oriented object which is a different way to tackle development.</p>
<p>In fact, Python is more considered as a scripting than a programming language and is, as every scripting technology, quite easy to handle. (Only if you don’t want to touch to preprocessor programming which is an another world ahah !)</p>
<p>Lastly, keep in mind that Google refers all you have to know <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>of course practicing the concept but don’t forget to also learn the inner workings of the code itself. I’ve recently started to realize that there’s more to coding then just coding. A computer is a very complex piece of technology and just because you can build a awesome piece of software but don’t understand the inner workings…</p>

</aside>
<p>Allow me to disagree with you. Yes, it is important to take into account how this magical thing works <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> However, it is widely considered as pre optimization and can severely impact on the stability and reliability of your software ! Just saying !</p>
<p>To conclude, start from the bottom with basic stuff then try to improve your code base. Here is, once again, from my point of vue, the best approach.</p>
<p><em>Some ideas of project :</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Mail client / server</li>
<li>Tools to automate LFI, RFI, XSS, etc.</li>
<li>Web crawler</li>
<li>API</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Nitrax</p>

            <p>I think the best way would be to read books (like, a shitload of them) and then after every chapter code your own software with the concepts you just learned so you understand how to use them.</p>
<p>It’s not theory &gt; practice or theory &lt; practice, but theory == practice.</p>

            <p>I would definitely recommend using Linux as a daily driver.  If you want to learn Python, I found <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Automate the Boring Stuff</a> by Al Sweigart to be both an intuitive introduction as well as contains many useful programming project suggestions to get you to begin actually writing code.  If you’re partial to more academic approaches, you could supplement the book using MIT’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX3jvD7XFPs&amp;list=PLB2BE3D6CA77BB8F7" rel="nofollow noopener">Introduction to CompSci and Programming</a>, which uses Python as its base language.  And, as always, ask questions around here. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I suggest grab a book and read,read,read… of course practicing the concept but don’t forget to also learn the inner workings of the code itself. I’ve recently started to realize that there’s more to coding then just coding. A computer is a very complex piece of technology and just because you can build a awesome piece of software but don’t understand the inner workings… well, that effort wouldn’t help much. I suggest reading the wannabe programming tutorials first so that way you at least understand how a computer interprets the code and how memory works, but at the same time learn your programming language that you find interesting. Hope that helps, cheers.</p>
