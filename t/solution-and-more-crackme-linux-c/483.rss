    <title>Solution and more. Crackme (Linux/C)</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/solution-and-more-crackme-linux-c/483</link>
    <description>So far, looks like only @dtm has provided a solution the [my little challenger](https://0x00sec.org/t/request-for-comments-crackme-linux-c/475) (not really a surprise :slight_smile:) . He also gave us a couple of hints on how to find a solution. I have already given a couple of hints as well in the comments but, in case you haven&#39;t manage to solve it and you are wondering how the hell this is done, keep reading...

Let&#39;s start with the binary with the symbols. This is the one I posted as a comment to the original crackme post and I will be referring to it as `c2`. I will name the original one (without symbols) `c1`.

# Cracking the binary with symbols

The one with the symbols is easier, in the sense that debugging tools can parse some information in the file and provide a more _human friendly_ view of the binary. 

The output of `objdump -d c2` will show us the different functions on the binary and will help us to understand what it does. Let&#39;s dump the asm into a file and open it with your preferred editor.

&gt; $ objdump -d c1 &gt; c1.dump
&gt; $ vim c1.dump

Now, we can look for the `main` function (press `ESC` + `:/main` + `ENTER`). You will see some calls to different functions. Namely: `my_print`, `my_getpass`, `obfuscate` and `strncmp`. This is an excerpt of the interesting part:


      400374:       bf 35 0b 40 00          mov    $0x400b35,%edi
      400379:       e8 44 ff ff ff          callq  4002c2 &lt;my_print&gt;
      40037e:       48 8b 0d 83 0c 20 00    mov    0x200c83(%rip),%rcx        # 601008 &lt;pass&gt;
      400385:       48 8b 45 f0             mov    -0x10(%rbp),%rax
      400389:       ba 20 00 00 00          mov    $0x20,%edx
      40038e:       48 89 ce                mov    %rcx,%rsi
      400391:       48 89 c7                mov    %rax,%rdi
      400394:       e8 c4 05 00 00          callq  40095d &lt;strncmp&gt;
      400399:       85 c0                   test   %eax,%eax
      40039b:       75 0c                   jne    4003a9 &lt;main+0xb9&gt;
      40039d:       bf 4b 0b 40 00          mov    $0x400b4b,%edi
      4003a2:       e8 1b ff ff ff          callq  4002c2 &lt;my_print&gt;


There is a first `my_print` function call, that is actually printing the message `Checking password`, and after that, there is a call to `strncmp`, a C function to compare two strings :o. 

The combination of `test` and `jne` will make the program jump if the value returned by `strncmp` is not zero (the return value is in the register `EAX`). In this case, if we just remove the `jne` instruction we should get our __OK__ message.

# Patching the Binary like a PRO

You can patch the binary file using many different tools, I&#39;m going to use a nifty trick I&#39;ve recently learned and that I think is pretty __hackish__.

So, open the binary file in `vim`. Yes, that&#39;s right. If `vim` is not your preferred text editor, what follows may change your mind.

Then type the following:

`ESC` + `:%!xxd` + `ENTER`

Pressing the `ESC` key instructs `vim` to go in the so-called _command mode_. The colon `:` will allow us to enter a command. The `%` is a wildcard meaning that, whatever command follows, has to be applied to the whole text. Finally the `!` will __run a shell command, passing as input the current `vim` buffer. The result of the shell command will be read back in `vim`, substituting the old data__.

So, try that, and you will get an hexdump of the binary that you can edit within `vim` as a normal text file.

Now, back to our patching task,  look for the instruction we where interested on: `0x75 0x0c` (check the `objdump` output above).

For doing that type  `/75 0c` to get to the instruction. You should see something like this

    ...
    0000390: ce48 89c7 e8c4 0500 0085 c075 0cbf 4b0b  .H.........u..K.
    00003a0: 4000 e81b ffff ffeb 0abf 5f0b 4000 e80f  @........._.@...
    ...

In the hexdump area change `75` and `0c` to `90 90` (reverse conversion will not work if you change the ASCII dump on the right).

    ...
    0000390: ce48 89c7 e8c4 0500 0085 c090 90bf 4b0b  .H.........u..K.
    00003a0: 4000 e81b ffff ffeb 0abf 5f0b 4000 e80f  @........._.@...
    ...

The value `90` is the opcode for the `nop` instruction. That means that we are just removing the conditional jump and letting the program go on and execute the success part of the comparison. We are effectively removing the check.

Now we have to write the binary data back to the file. First convert back the hexdump into binary data using `ESC` + `:%!xxd -r` + `ENTER`. Then you just need to save and exit with the traditional `:wq`.

Try to run the program now!

# Cracking the Binary without Symbols
For this one (the one in the original post), we need to work a little bit more... but not much. Now, an `objdump`, will not shown any information about functions or its name... Just one single assembly block. So, for this one we are going to use the string analysis method as suggested by @dtm.

He may had done it in a different way, but this is one way of doing it.

The idea is to locate the string containing the success message in the program, and then, figure out how the program ends up printing this string. In this case we are looking for the print and then we are moving back from there to find the condition that fires that print. So there we go!

First thing you have to know. String literals are read only data  and, therefore, they get stored in the `.rodata` section (`ro` stands for read only). So, let&#39;s ask `objdump` to show us what is in there.

  $ objdump -s c1 | grep -A 15 .rodata

      Contents of section .rodata:
       40098c 30783030 20436861 6c6c656e 6765720a  0x00 Challenger.

       400a2c 454c4f41 44007661 6c677269 6e6400    ELOAD.valgrind.


We can easily find the string `&quot; OK\n+ YOu did it!&quot;`. This string is located at `0x4009bc + 2  = 0x4009be`. Now we just have to search for that address in the assembly code.

_NOTE: If you do not want to add hex numbers and you have installed radare, try the command iz_

    $  objdump -d c1 | grep -C 5 4009be
      400198:	48 8b 35 61 0e 20 00 	mov    0x200e61(%rip),%rsi        # 0x601000
      40019f:	48 89 df             	mov    %rbx,%rdi
      4001a2:	ba 20 00 00 00       	mov    $0x20,%edx
      4001a7:	e8 5a 06 00 00       	callq  0x400806
      4001ac:	85 c0                	test   %eax,%eax
      4001ae:	bf be 09 40 00       	mov    $0x4009be,%edi
      4001b3:	74 05                	je     0x4001ba
      4001b5:	bf d2 09 40 00       	mov    $0x4009d2,%edi
      4001ba:	e8 ed 00 00 00       	callq  0x4002ac
      4001bf:	bf e7 09 40 00       	mov    $0x4009e7,%edi
      4001c4:	e8 e3 00 00 00       	callq  0x4002ac

We can see how address `0x4001ae` loads the `edi` register with the pointer to the string we are interested on  (the success message or __good boy__). And just below, we find a jump _if Equal_ (`je`), otherwise, we load `edi` with a pointer to the fail message (check the .rodata dump above if you do not believe me... that&#39;s the __bad boy__). 

To crack/patch this one we can proceed in two different ways:

1. Change the `je` conditional jump into a normal jump... changing the byte `0x74` to `0xeb` (this actually convers `je` in `jmp`.
2. `NOP` the `mov` loading `edi` with the fail message.

In this case both will work, but in the general case, solution 1 is preferred. The reason is that the code to be executed is probably more complex that just loading a register with a string address and we may not be done with just writing 5 `NOP`s.

So... go an patch the binary. Now you know how to do it with `vim`!

# Wrapping up

The title of this post said, &quot;Solution and more&quot;. You may be wondering what was the _more_ in the title. Well, by now : 

* ... you have already learned how to patch binaries with `vim`. That is pretty awesome, and also useful
* ... you have also learned how to convert a binary into a text file and recover it... I have an curious idea on how to take advantage of this.

There is a third thing, that I will save for another post, but just in case you haven&#39;t noticed it... we had build a 5Kb __STATIC__ binary. Just for you to realise what this means:

      $  cat &lt;&lt; EOP &gt; a.c; gcc -static -o a a.c &amp;&amp; ls -lh a.out
      &gt; int main(){return 0;}
      &gt; EOP
      -rwxrwxr-x 1 pico pico 859K May 24 17:22 a.out

Yes. A static binary that does nothing takes more than 800Kb!!!

Happy Hacking!</description>

            <p>Okay, I’ve been reversing your program and I think I’ve got it, though there are some things I do not understand. Your <code>my_getpass</code> function is pretty unclear to me since I have no idea what <code>tcgetattr</code> and <code>tcsetattr</code> do (I think it has to do with modifying the input mechanism from the user), all I could recognize within the function was the <code>read</code> but that wasn’t really helpful (not sure why <code>fd</code> was <code>0x1</code>). After debugging it, I know that it returns <code>7</code>. In your <code>obfuscate</code> function, I could identify the overall structure of the routine, something along the lines of</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cpp">int obfuscate(malloc_var, ipass, 0x20) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 0x20; i++) {
        // something in here to do with XORing
        // the malloc (user input) and ipass variables.
        malloc_var[i] ^= ipass[i]
    }
    return i;
}
</code></pre>
<p>which I then assumed you were obfuscating the user’s input with the bytes of <code>ipass</code> which will be compared later with the already obfuscated original password in the <code>pass</code> variable using <code>strcmp</code>. That then lead me to XOR <code>ipass</code> and <code>pass</code> together like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-makefile">ipass XOR pass
-------------------------
0x23  XOR 0x62 = 0x41 (A)
0x89  XOR 0xCB = 0x42 (B)
0xF2  XOR 0xB1 = 0x43 (C)
0xC2  XOR 0x86 = 0x44 (D)
0x6D  XOR 0x28 = 0x45 (E)
0x3E  XOR 0x78 = 0x46 (F)
0xC7  XOR 0x80 = 0x47 (G)
0xB2  XOR 0xB2 = 0x00 (0)
</code></pre>
<p>which is coincidentally the length of what I got from the <code>my_getpass</code> function and also the password you have already provided above.</p>
<p>Thanks for providing this challenge. I had fun reversing it and I hope that I’ve gotten quite a bit of experience from doing it.</p>

            <p>And here I was busy reverse engineering the entire program to C (I failed kinda).<br>
Well I didn’t think of a binary patch, this VIM stuff is really cool.<br>
I’m still amazed at all functionalities VIM has.<br>

            <p>I forgot to say, It’s looks like <code>je</code> to <code>jmp</code> binary representation not correct. Because if I’m changing <code>0x74</code> to <code>0xbf</code> I’m get error something like ‘Segmentation fault’. So I’ve found some table assembly opcodes with their binary representation, where <code>jmp</code> represented with <code>0xeb</code> and this works for me.</p>

            <p>It is. If you want to try, it is <code>ABCDEFG</code>.</p>
<p>You can try to reverse the <code>obfuscate</code> function works and obtain the key, instead of cracking the program. That usually requires more effort that just breaking the check… that computationally speaking is simpler.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So far, looks like only <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/dtm">@dtm</a> has provided a solution the <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/request-for-comments-crackme-linux-c/475">my little challenger</a> (not really a surprise <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">) . He also gave us a couple of hints on how to find a solution. I have already given a couple of hints as well in the comments but, in case you haven’t manage to solve it and you are wondering how the hell this is done, keep reading…</p>
<p>Let’s start with the binary with the symbols. This is the one I posted as a comment to the original crackme post and I will be referring to it as <code>c2</code>. I will name the original one (without symbols) <code>c1</code>.</p>
<h1>Cracking the binary with symbols</h1>
<p>The one with the symbols is easier, in the sense that debugging tools can parse some information in the file and provide a more <em>human friendly</em> view of the binary.</p>
<p>The output of <code>objdump -d c2</code> will show us the different functions on the binary and will help us to understand what it does. Let’s dump the asm into a file and open it with your preferred editor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$ objdump -d c1 &gt; c1.dump<br>
$ vim c1.dump</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we can look for the <code>main</code> function (press <code>ESC</code> + <code>:/main</code> + <code>ENTER</code>). You will see some calls to different functions. Namely: <code>my_print</code>, <code>my_getpass</code>, <code>obfuscate</code> and <code>strncmp</code>. This is an excerpt of the interesting part:</p>
<pre><code>  400374:       bf 35 0b 40 00          mov    $0x400b35,%edi
  400379:       e8 44 ff ff ff          callq  4002c2 &lt;my_print&gt;
  40037e:       48 8b 0d 83 0c 20 00    mov    0x200c83(%rip),%rcx        # 601008 &lt;pass&gt;
  400385:       48 8b 45 f0             mov    -0x10(%rbp),%rax
  400389:       ba 20 00 00 00          mov    $0x20,%edx
  40038e:       48 89 ce                mov    %rcx,%rsi
  400391:       48 89 c7                mov    %rax,%rdi
  400394:       e8 c4 05 00 00          callq  40095d &lt;strncmp&gt;
  400399:       85 c0                   test   %eax,%eax
  40039b:       75 0c                   jne    4003a9 &lt;main+0xb9&gt;
  40039d:       bf 4b 0b 40 00          mov    $0x400b4b,%edi
  4003a2:       e8 1b ff ff ff          callq  4002c2 &lt;my_print&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>There is a first <code>my_print</code> function call, that is actually printing the message <code>Checking password</code>, and after that, there is a call to <code>strncmp</code>, a C function to compare two strings :o.</p>
<p>The combination of <code>test</code> and <code>jne</code> will make the program jump if the value returned by <code>strncmp</code> is not zero (the return value is in the register <code>EAX</code>). In this case, if we just remove the <code>jne</code> instruction we should get our <strong>OK</strong> message.</p>
<h1>Patching the Binary like a PRO</h1>
<p>You can patch the binary file using many different tools, I’m going to use a nifty trick I’ve recently learned and that I think is pretty <strong>hackish</strong>.</p>
<p>So, open the binary file in <code>vim</code>. Yes, that’s right. If <code>vim</code> is not your preferred text editor, what follows may change your mind.</p>
<p>Then type the following:</p>
<p><code>ESC</code> + <code>:%!xxd</code> + <code>ENTER</code></p>
<p>Pressing the <code>ESC</code> key instructs <code>vim</code> to go in the so-called <em>command mode</em>. The colon <code>:</code> will allow us to enter a command. The <code>%</code> is a wildcard meaning that, whatever command follows, has to be applied to the whole text. Finally the <code>!</code> will <strong>run a shell command, passing as input the current <code>vim</code> buffer. The result of the shell command will be read back in <code>vim</code>, substituting the old data</strong>.</p>
<p>So, try that, and you will get an hexdump of the binary that you can edit within <code>vim</code> as a normal text file.</p>
<p>Now, back to our patching task,  look for the instruction we where interested on: <code>0x75 0x0c</code> (check the <code>objdump</code> output above).</p>
<p>For doing that type  <code>/75 0c</code> to get to the instruction. You should see something like this</p>
<pre><code>...
0000390: ce48 89c7 e8c4 0500 0085 c075 0cbf 4b0b  .H.........u..K.
00003a0: 4000 e81b ffff ffeb 0abf 5f0b 4000 e80f  @........._.@...
...
</code></pre>
<p>In the hexdump area change <code>75</code> and <code>0c</code> to <code>90 90</code> (reverse conversion will not work if you change the ASCII dump on the right).</p>
<pre><code>...
0000390: ce48 89c7 e8c4 0500 0085 c090 90bf 4b0b  .H.........u..K.
00003a0: 4000 e81b ffff ffeb 0abf 5f0b 4000 e80f  @........._.@...
...
</code></pre>
<p>The value <code>90</code> is the opcode for the <code>nop</code> instruction. That means that we are just removing the conditional jump and letting the program go on and execute the success part of the comparison. We are effectively removing the check.</p>
<p>Now we have to write the binary data back to the file. First convert back the hexdump into binary data using <code>ESC</code> + <code>:%!xxd -r</code> + <code>ENTER</code>. Then you just need to save and exit with the traditional <code>:wq</code>.</p>
<p>Try to run the program now!</p>
<h1>Cracking the Binary without Symbols</h1>
<p>For this one (the one in the original post), we need to work a little bit more… but not much. Now, an <code>objdump</code>, will not shown any information about functions or its name… Just one single assembly block. So, for this one we are going to use the string analysis method as suggested by <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/dtm">@dtm</a>.</p>
<p>He may had done it in a different way, but this is one way of doing it.</p>
<p>The idea is to locate the string containing the success message in the program, and then, figure out how the program ends up printing this string. In this case we are looking for the print and then we are moving back from there to find the condition that fires that print. So there we go!</p>
<p>First thing you have to know. String literals are read only data  and, therefore, they get stored in the <code>.rodata</code> section (<code>ro</code> stands for read only). So, let’s ask <code>objdump</code> to show us what is in there.</p>
<p>$ objdump -s c1 | grep -A 15 .rodata</p>
<pre><code>  Contents of section .rodata:
   40098c 30783030 20436861 6c6c656e 6765720a  0x00 Challenger.

   400a2c 454c4f41 44007661 6c677269 6e6400    ELOAD.valgrind.
</code></pre>
<p>We can easily find the string <code>" OK\n+ YOu did it!"</code>. This string is located at <code>0x4009bc + 2  = 0x4009be</code>. Now we just have to search for that address in the assembly code.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: If you do not want to add hex numbers and you have installed radare, try the command iz</em></p>
<pre><code>$  objdump -d c1 | grep -C 5 4009be
  400198:	48 8b 35 61 0e 20 00 	mov    0x200e61(%rip),%rsi        # 0x601000
  40019f:	48 89 df             	mov    %rbx,%rdi
  4001a2:	ba 20 00 00 00       	mov    $0x20,%edx
  4001a7:	e8 5a 06 00 00       	callq  0x400806
  4001ac:	85 c0                	test   %eax,%eax
  4001ae:	bf be 09 40 00       	mov    $0x4009be,%edi
  4001b3:	74 05                	je     0x4001ba
  4001b5:	bf d2 09 40 00       	mov    $0x4009d2,%edi
  4001ba:	e8 ed 00 00 00       	callq  0x4002ac
  4001bf:	bf e7 09 40 00       	mov    $0x4009e7,%edi
  4001c4:	e8 e3 00 00 00       	callq  0x4002ac
</code></pre>
<p>We can see how address <code>0x4001ae</code> loads the <code>edi</code> register with the pointer to the string we are interested on  (the success message or <strong>good boy</strong>). And just below, we find a jump <em>if Equal</em> (<code>je</code>), otherwise, we load <code>edi</code> with a pointer to the fail message (check the .rodata dump above if you do not believe me… that’s the <strong>bad boy</strong>).</p>
<p>To crack/patch this one we can proceed in two different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change the <code>je</code> conditional jump into a normal jump… changing the byte <code>0x74</code> to <code>0xeb</code> (this actually convers <code>je</code> in <code>jmp</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>NOP</code> the <code>mov</code> loading <code>edi</code> with the fail message.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case both will work, but in the general case, solution 1 is preferred. The reason is that the code to be executed is probably more complex that just loading a register with a string address and we may not be done with just writing 5 <code>NOP</code>s.</p>
<p>So… go an patch the binary. Now you know how to do it with <code>vim</code>!</p>
<h1>Wrapping up</h1>
<p>The title of this post said, “Solution and more”. You may be wondering what was the <em>more</em> in the title. Well, by now :</p>
<ul>
<li>… you have already learned how to patch binaries with <code>vim</code>. That is pretty awesome, and also useful</li>
<li>… you have also learned how to convert a binary into a text file and recover it… I have an curious idea on how to take advantage of this.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a third thing, that I will save for another post, but just in case you haven’t noticed it… we had build a 5Kb <strong>STATIC</strong> binary. Just for you to realise what this means:</p>
<pre><code>  $  cat &lt;&lt; EOP &gt; a.c; gcc -static -o a a.c &amp;&amp; ls -lh a.out
  &gt; int main(){return 0;}
  &gt; EOP
  -rwxrwxr-x 1 pico pico 859K May 24 17:22 a.out
</code></pre>
<p>Yes. A static binary that does nothing takes more than 800Kb!!!</p>
<p>Happy Hacking!</p>
