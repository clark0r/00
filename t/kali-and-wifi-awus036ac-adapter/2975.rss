    <title>Kali and WIFI AWUS036AC Adapter</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/kali-and-wifi-awus036ac-adapter/2975</link>
    <description>Hello, I have to admit that I&#39;m a total noob when it comes to Kali...and linux in general.

So with that said I&#39;m likely just missing something very basic...

I have Kali 2017 rolling release, fully updated, I have the AWUS036AC adapter.  I have installed the latest drivers from the apt-get process. lsusb sees the adapter as:
 
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 0bda:8812 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8812AU 802.11a/b/g/n/ac WLAN Adapter

BUT I don&#39;t see the adapter when using ifconfig or iwconfig.  It&#39;s driving me crazy.  I can&#39;t figure out what I&#39;m missing. From everything I&#39;ve read, it should be listed there and it should work.  Perhaps it might not work flawlessly but right now I&#39;d be happy the system saw it and could use it.

I found this post...

Any help is greatly appreciated.

            <p>open terminal and tip # <em><strong>lspci</strong></em> and search for your adapter, maybe Kali didn’t recognize him<br>
and maybe try other usb slots <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
