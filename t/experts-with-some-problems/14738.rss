            <p>Everything can be learned on your own, establishing your professional career can be done with certifications to show you’ve tested your knowledge; you do not need a prior class, hours or mentorship to attempt most technical certifications applicable to pentesting, with the exception of PWK/OSCP.</p>
<p>I would suggest developing fundamental networking, linux and programming skills as a start to your path.</p>
