    <title>Yikes, can someone help me with networking?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/yikes-can-someone-help-me-with-networking/553</link>
    <description>So I recently moved and my wonderful ISP changed several of my plans which cost more (Had to change them) but the most...interesting bug was that whenever I connected a device to my network, I had to use ipconfig /release and /renew just to connect properly. 

While playing with router settings I enabled AP mode which is not configured and now I am in a bad situation, like that fox, sheep, duck puzzle game. 

1) In order to get out of AP mode, I need to log into the router.
2) I cannot connect to 192.168.1.1 because it is in AP mode. None of my wifi works as well.
3) In order to get online I had hardwired the ethernet from my modem to my PC. 
4) I read a bit and some people had issues like this, where they had to reset the subnets on their network. However I would not want to damage anything further.</description>

            <p>Right. I know the solution. <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/anon79434934">@anon79434934</a> is with me on this I’m sure.</p>
<h1>Steps to Solve your Awful Issue</h1>
<ol>
<li>Remove the screws on the bottom of the modem</li>
<li>Look for some ambiguous pins</li>
<li>Poke around with a osciliator trying to find a signal</li>
<li>Solder your serial cable to the pins, hopefully you’ve found them by looking or digging around with your osciliator.</li>
<li>Connect your soldered serial to USB cable to your computer, open a serial console with minicom, and log into the router, the credientials are probably default.</li>
<li>Dig around the commands, and find a reset command.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve already reset the modem and the router. Sadly it appears I’ll have to dive into some subnettings or something to fix this problem.</p>
