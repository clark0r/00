            <p>Why the onion sites I create keep disappearing? Once I get a new address from TOR and  upload them to the host they can be seen.But once I log out and try to access the sites they are gone. What is the problem?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi, Ok, sure someone will find this funny, I started learning to kinda program back in DOS days with batch files (that was the funny part??) Anyway due to life circmstances only recent was able to get back into it, recently i’ve been learning what I guess would be called full stack dev languages. I had started C’s a Looong time ago (which Ive all forgotten) but that is my next priority. Am probably most comfortable with php &amp; sql  for the moment, no where near good at it but i eventually get what im trying to do to work. But anyway what Im trying to figure out, (im sure this is probably a dumb question), but how, where do i go to try the hack the box??  Is that what the<br>
Init (initialize?) link at top of screen is reffering too?</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I’m a long time lurker of this site and finally decided to sign up.</p>
<p>I code in python and occasionally C.</p>
<p>I joined so that I could become more active in the hacking community as I’m scared of going too much to the developer side.</p>
