    <title>Possible App for 0x00sec</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/possible-app-for-0x00sec/837</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve tried accessing 0x00sec lately on my phone via the browser. It&#39;s definitely better then trying to access Null-Byte on my phone, but is there a possibility for maybe a stand alone app for this particular site? I was curious if there could be enough interest because I would definitely use it. Just wondering if there could be a possibility.</description>

            <p>The only problem is that the app could be a complete disaster at the same time. Although it is a good idea. Perhaps lets wait- see the community grow and then decide to make such a thing.</p>

            <p>A lot of people do use mobile. Do you mean just a web-view? I think the current web-application version is sufficient as of now. There are talks about Discourse making a companion app, so we’ll have to see.</p>
