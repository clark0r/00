    <title>Flaghammer: A tool for King of the Hill CTFs</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/flaghammer-a-tool-for-king-of-the-hill-ctfs/2971</link>
    <description>Hi all!

A friend was entering a CTF he suspected was &quot;king of the hill&quot; style, which would require him to set and maintain control over a flag file, so he requested some techniques or ideas from me. I gave him a couple of other ideas, but this tool was the one of the products of that discussion.

It&#39;s small, it&#39;s simple, and it&#39;s fast. It watches a file you give it, writes the file if it doesn&#39;t already exist, and enters a loop checking the contents of the file every round. If the contents have changed (compares bytes), it rewrites the file. Quickly.

I told him to compile it and stick it somewhere in the $PATH with the name that wouldn&#39;t look suspicious and probably wouldn&#39;t be used during the event (`htop` maybe?) so that someone running `ps aux` wouldn&#39;t get tipped off so easily.

Let me know what you think in the comments.
