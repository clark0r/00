    <title>Social Engineering Toolkit. Inserting False Hyperlinks into the Body of an Email Using the Mass Emailler Feature?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/social-engineering-toolkit-inserting-false-hyperlinks-into-the-body-of-an-email-using-the-mass-emailler-feature/3240</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently creating a tutorial for the basic usage of SET (Social Engineering Toolkit) for my university&#39;s cyber security club and I&#39;ve come across a question that I&#39;ve had little to no luck finding the answer to. In the previous section of the tutorial, we used the website attack vector function to create a localized phishing ploy. The next step is to craft an email that tricks someone into clicking on a link that brings them back to our local IP address. I was hoping to integrate the two features and insert a fake hyperlink that reads something like &quot;Totally Legit IT link&quot; but actually hides a link to a different destination. Does anyone know if the mass emailer supports such a feature? If yes, how would i go about calling it. 

Thanks in advance

            <p>As I have come to learn, the program does indeed support HTML5. Thanks for the insight, I think I’m on the right track now.</p>

            <p>Is HTML supported?</p>
<p>You could also step it up with a <a href="https://bit.ly" rel="nofollow noopener">bit.ly</a> link.</p>
<p>Additionally, providing the last installment of your tutorial series would be helpful for scope.</p>
