    <title>Shameless self-promotion: Ops tools for hackers</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/shameless-self-promotion-ops-tools-for-hackers/2187</link>
    <description>Hello fellow 0x00sec-ers! 

I just had a good talk with @pry0cc about doing some posts within my specialty, operations. I firmly believe that a strong foundation in operations is essential for any aspiring hacker, as you need to understand the systems you&#39;re breaking. To that end, I will be cross-posting articles I write on my own blog here with a special focus on using ops tools for evil. 

This first article (in what _might_ be a series) is less evil, still fun. I used our very own pet chatbot, MissMoneyPenney, to demonstrate two really cool tools, Consul and consul-template. Check it out, let me know your thoughts, and tell me how you might want to use something like Consul and consul-template for bad things.
