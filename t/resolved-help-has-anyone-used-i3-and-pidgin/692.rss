    <title>[Resolved] Help! Has anyone used i3 and Pidgin?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/resolved-help-has-anyone-used-i3-and-pidgin/692</link>
    <description>I just got i3 and I looove it, but I can&#39;t seem to get Pidgin to work. The process will run, but no window shows up. Any ideas?

I could use `irssi`, but I really don&#39;t want to. I like pidgin.</description>
