    <title>Getting Involved in 0x00sec with GitLab</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/getting-involved-in-0x00sec-with-gitlab/1251</link>
    <description>With the [announcement of pupper](https://0x00sec.org/t/introducing-a-stack-of-new-things/1250) and a few other things over these last few months, our collaborative effort is off to a nice start. Many of us regulars have been working together on a handful of projects. We&#39;re now offering a place to put all those projects!

In order to draw in more of you, the Admins thought to make a little tutorial on how to get involved.

To start, please go to [git.0x00sec.org](https://git.0x00sec.org/users/sign_in) and make an account.

You&#39;ll see something like:

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/c/c889d2b9b8bdfefe41f4b3e80d428dccd3db8cb8.png&quot; width=&quot;494&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
(Mine is black because I use a page-inversion browser plugin)

Make a new account! Confirm your email. Pretty straightforward. Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll see when you make a new account:

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/1/18b65528a172090357a19c6b2d557e33e8ba6826.png&quot; width=&quot;507&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;

Click on [Browse Projects](https://git.0x00sec.org/explore/projects/trending) at the bottom of that page. You&#39;ll see the pupper repository. Right now, it&#39;s the only Trending repo.

Here&#39;s what that repository page looks like:

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/8/84c5a204ba0a1de7465812694f3c0af859a177a6.png&quot; width=&quot;508&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;

Whoops! What&#39;s this...?

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/a/ac98927db37d2e3633feb5726fd297cff1bdf461.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;88&quot;&gt;

Looks like we need to add an ssh key! Easy enough. Here&#39;s how [[1]](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/):

_If you already have an SSH key, you can skip the key-generation steps._

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;your_email@example.com&quot;

It is important that you use whatever email you used to sign up on GitLab.

You&#39;ll then see:

    Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa):

If you are making another SSH key, you will need to specify a new file name for this one. Otherwise, just hit `[ENTER]`.

The program will then ask you for a passphrase. You can hit enter to leave it blank, but I ___highly___ recommend that you make a password for your SSH key(s).

You&#39;ll then have to ensure that your `ssh-agent` is running. After, you must add your new key to the agent.

    $ eval &quot;$(ssh-agent -s)&quot;
    $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

___Note:___ _If you named your SSH key something different, specify that filepath instead._

Next, you&#39;ll need this program (on linux):


    $ sudo apt-get install xclip


Then, run

    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | xclip -selection c

It is ___very important___ that you copy your __public__ key and ___NOT___ your private key. Guard your private key(s) as if they were your life!!!

Now that you have the key copied to your clipboard, navigate to your Profile Settings:

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/e/e7584cae45930f05ed614ff5bc0b81362e32f32f.png&quot; width=&quot;188&quot; height=&quot;180&quot;&gt;

Then, head to the [SSH Keys](https://git.0x00sec.org/profile/keys) tab:

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/5/55e7fc77437ddc4ab2f6164137d75c71e4968770.png&quot; width=&quot;652&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;

Paste your __public key__ where it says to paste it. Give it a descriptive title so you know what that key is for or where that key is from.

Once you&#39;re done, open `~/.ssh/config` in your editor of choice and add:

    Host gitlab.s-3.tech
      HostName gitlab.s-3.tech
      User git
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      Port 31337

If your ssh key has a different filepath or name, substitute `~/.ssh/id_rsa` with that. Here, you&#39;ll want to specify the path to your __private key__.

Alright, now you should be able to:

    $ git clone git@gitlab.s-3.tech:pry0cc/pupper.git

We&#39;re excited to see what comes of this.

            <p>Seems like they messed up the https cert by issuing it to <a href="https://gitlab.s-3.tech" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gitlab.s-3.tech</a> instead of <a href="https://git.0x00sec.org/">https://git.0x00sec.org/</a><br>
You can still use it either in a fresh browser installation(because of HSTS) or just click the s-3.tech link</p>

            <p>Great job <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/oaktree">@oaktree</a>! Really nice overview of how to do it. I was partially afraid that GitLab might’ve put some users off, although once you cut through the noise, it’s a really nice interface for Git.</p>
<p>Plus we have a lot of really cool projects going on our GitLab, it’d be a shame to see them go to waste <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
