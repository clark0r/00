NOTE:    hey friends last year i quit my job, now am a full time freelancer and IT security teacher

This my take on malware development were we are going to develop from a prototype already out there to a something much more powerful

If you a cybersecurity professional, a pen tester, red teamer,having the skills to write undetectable malware is great and very rewarding.

Pros tend to use tools like metasploit, LordPE, shelter, veil, amitarge and others to accomplish given tasks but their is always a high possibility of getting caught by SOC team av solutions and that is not good.



Another reason to write your FUD malware from scratch is to eliminate the need for Metasploit, since it can handle only one connection at a time.  Whereas, during red teaming we always needed a CnC Server solution that can handle and control all the target machines together just like a botnet.

So in these series were are going to begin our journey of learning malware development at the same time applying software engineering principles, cryptography, forensics, networking and obfuscation from the basic principles to the most in the wild.

OUR ROAD MAP OUT OF ORDER

&gt;Simple malware (prototype)
&gt;Basics of software engineering
&gt;Choosing a software methodology to follow
&gt;Rewriting our malware from scratch
&gt;digital forensics basics
&gt;Basics of penetration testing
&gt;Basics of red teaming
&gt;Basics of cryptography
&gt;window system programming
&gt;Networking programming
&gt;Driver and kernel programming
&gt;Adding rootkit features to our product

Shall add others to the mix as needed


Prerequisites
Python programming skills (soon videos will be available)
C/C++ programming skills

FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR PROTOTYPE

whoami function
pwd function
ls function
move/ copy function
delete file function
download file function
upload file function


one thing to avoid is  executing  most of the commands via command shell Win API, reason being that it becomes easier for endpoint monitoring tools to detect anomalies and find out that it’s a suspicious binary even though we can evade anti-virus software easily.

 But  still we should  write this code, because you never know when you might need to execute shell commands or execute powershell/vbs/batch scripts remotely, and secondly, it is the easiest to start with as a beginner when learning malware development.</description>
