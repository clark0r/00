    <title>HackTheBox for Learning Hacking</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/hackthebox-for-learning-hacking/9241</link>
    <description>Hello, 0x00ers! 

As you may have heard me talk about before, I am a strong advocate of using labs and CTF platforms for learning to hack and learning the skills involved in performing pentests from day to day. 

I believe they&#39;re a great way to learn new skills, practice and validate your enumeration and attacking practices, as well as get exposure to new and fun technologies that you may not have exposure to legally by other means.

For a long time, I have used sites like https://www.vulnhub.com/ in order to practice, however, this has required me often to download a large VM (usually 2-3GB+), install it in my hypervisor, and hope it works. Then, assuming I had the power to run a VM, I&#39;d be able to hack it, find the flag and feel the buzz of breaking into a box and seeing that `root.txt`, sexy hash.

There is nothing wrong with this method, I think it&#39;s a great resource for people. However, somewhat recently I have come across this new platform called [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), and I was super impressed with what I found.

![enter image description here](upload://6pLSbllwR1alu2ElWsVTRKL5aDL.png)

You create an account (which you can only obtain by hacking the site), and then you download a VPN profile (which is free), and then you connect to the VPN and can hack a large array of boxes, get the flags, and input them into the platform. It shows up on your profile and you get a title: &quot;Script Kiddie, Hacker&quot; etc.

What is really nice about this is that you can compete with other people, as well as work together with other people on boxes. It gives you a chance to test your skills against boxes running Windows, Linux, BSD and even Solaris. Boxes vary a lot from webservers servers to switches, to old retro machines. 

Some of the boxes can be really challenging as well, such as Nightmare, which made some waves on Twitter after it&#39;s release:

https://twitter.com/mubix/status/1009141212320804866

Overall, it&#39;s a really cool platform, boxes are turned over and released very often, and is all done really well. Because I really appreciated the platform, I got myself a VIP subscription because I really believe in supporting people like HackTheBox that allow people to get their fix of hacking, legally, and in a productive way, as well as the ability to get access to practically untouched boxes, so they&#39;re super fast, it&#39;s like hitting a box in your local network. 

The free labs can be slow occasionally, but you can obtain a VIP subscription, it&#39;s really a no-brainer for what you get out of it, including the potential to improve your skills and do better in your day-to-day profession.

# 0x00sec + HackTheBox Partnership

Today, we are proud to say that 0x00sec is now in partnership with [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/). What this means for the community is that we will have the ability to provide VIP subscriptions free of charge to winners of future 0x00sec CTFs, as well as those who show a real desire to lead the community and regularly contribute, but just don&#39;t have the means to stretch to VIP.

We hope to start more regular HackTheBox sessions, where we can collaborate and work and learn on boxes together as a community.

![enter image description here](upload://3IScwbUqkFeYPzLzVSQtSng0VHN.png)

This might involve things such as retired-boxes writeups and internal-community competitions to root new boxes.

In order to support HackTheBox and our partnership, if you haven&#39;t done so already, we strongly recommend that you not only go and make an account at HTB but you also get a VIP subscription. There are really no platforms like this around, and it costs money to host boxes across the world in order to provide a good CTF platform for hobbyists and professionals alike. 

If you want to support the 0x00sec community, and invest in yourself and your skills at the same time, create an account at [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/invite) and get yourself a VIP subscription. I already have one as do many other 0x00sec members. We even have a #htb channel in the IRC!

Tell me in the comments, what do you think about HackTheBox? What are your favorite boxes? How long have you been using HTB?</description>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/laxudope">@laxudope</a> Maybe the people you messaged are currently busy? Sometimes that happens. The HTB team used to be open to everyone until just a few days ago, but eventually most of its members started being inactive and now only VIP users can be part of it, to have an actual active group made of trusted people who can all discuss in one place, even if it means having a smaller team. We should update the old posts to say explicitly the team is no longer open.</p>

            <p>Yes, only the VIP members are able to join the HTB team of 0x00sec. It is one of the few perks of being a VIP member as is being able to join on Discord. One can earn VIP membership by being fairly active on the forum and the community as whole. Providing help and contributing valuable information to the community like topic discussions, comments and articles, tutorials, anything that is worth cents counts. You have to have a good positive presence in the community for you to be considered as such.</p>

is there any relation between “0x00sec VIP” and “0x00HTB team”.</p>
<p>I don’t know why people first want to add people in their HTB team and after that they not responds to someone who really want to do it.</p>

            <p>I found out about this partnership only now, shame on me. Projects like this should be very good incentives to push people into making their contribution for this community, because we all benefit from it and these are great opportunities to learn new things and have fun together. Thank you <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a>, it’s time to get some work done.</p>

            <p>This is a great idea! I don’t have all that much space for any more virtual boxes on my computer. I have a couple right now, but I would like to play with more. This is a great opportunity to do so!</p>

            <p>Yes HackTheBox anc <a href="http://attackdefense.com" rel="nofollow noopener">attackdefense.com</a> are the two main sites I highly recommend.</p>
<p>Not all have the budget, but I invest in a home lab which has switches and two enterprise servers with ESXi to work on devops stuff and learning containerization, security tools, and more.</p>

            <p>First of all, I want to congratulate <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a> for making this partnership happen. And, of course, the others involved and HackTheBox for offering an excellent platform for us to have fun; improve creativity and pentest skills. This whole thing is awesome!</p>
<p>I’m new to the pentesting area. I came from the REsearch area (on Linux environment). So, I have some familiarity with low-level things. I believe that every researcher must obtain the skill and malice of a pentester. – That’s the reason why I’m here and be enrolled in HTB.</p>
<p>I’ve my subscription in a couple months ago, but I really start to playing in a couple weeks. In a few days, I acquired my VIP pass at HTB for the same reason of…</p>

<p>I really believe in supporting people like HackTheBox that allow people to get their fix of hacking, legally, and in a productive way, as well as the ability to get access to practically untouched boxes, so they’re super fast, it’s like hitting a box in your local network.</p>

<p>There’s another platform that I was impressed with. So, I believe it’s worth giving support to them as well: <a href="https://attackdefense.com/members" rel="nofollow noopener">https://attackdefense.com/members</a> (from PentesterAcademy)</p>

            <p>While hackthebox is a great platform, I also feel I should warn you about some “risks”. Unlike vulnhub, htb is an online platform, meaning other, more skilled hackers, can be on the same box as you while you are still on it. Htb certainly takes measures to protect you, but they can’t do everything. They attract highly skilled people too, and god knows what their intentions might be. Htb states this themselves.</p>
<p>I recommend to use a vm specifically for htb just in case it gets compromised. If you be wise with htb, it is a WONDERFUL platform!</p>
