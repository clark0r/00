    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/tips-on-being-organized-and-prioritizing-stuff/9360</link>
    <description>So basically I&#39;m really the procrastinate kind of guy. I can&#39;t keep deadlines and I always do things last hour.

**People who function like clockwork, I summon you!** 
_Tip me on how to be more organized, please and thank you!_</description>

Consider making/getting a planner that has a schedule in it and write down/type in where your deadlines are set. If it is on a phone, set an alarm to remind you of what you have. I recommend trying every other person’s way above. I personally find writing my schedule down is my better way to memorize what I have, but hey everyone thinks differently and has their unique way of doing things. You just have to find what best works for you. Good Luck!</p>

            <p>Here is what worked for me…</p>
<p>I took a notebook and well, almost everyday I wrote down a To Do List. The only flaw is that I never looked at the list again. XD</p>

            <p>You have to beat yourself into following <strong>some</strong> sort of plan. Trust me, as a fellow procrastinator the only way I’m able to get things done is if I make myself follow the plan I’ve said I will. It’s all too easy to procrastinate looking for ways to stop procrastinating. Then you end up in a vicious circle of wasting time.</p>

            <p>Make a work plan and stick to it for long enough to make it a habit. Repeat, repeat, repeat.</p>
<p>Leave a generous portion of down-time to prevent burn out.  Isolate what’s important and use them as the foundation to build upon.</p>
