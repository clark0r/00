    <title>C# Reversing - Unpacking A Packer ~ MegaDumper [Part 3]</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/c-reversing-unpacking-a-packer-megadumper-part-3/1227</link>
    <description>Hey mates,

in the [last part](https://0x00sec.org/t/c-reversing-unpacking-a-packer-part-2/1219/3) I used MSIL to add a `File.WriteAllBytes()` call, for dumping the packed executable. This time I show you a much easier way for dumping .NET-applications called MegaDumper.

---
## MegaDumper
MegaDumper is a tool which can easily dump .NET-executables directly from memory without the need of a skilled reverser :wink:. When the application is better protected than our example last time, it could be useful to have a one-click dumper. If you&#39;re interested in how MegaDumper does the job, just decompile the application and have a look at it. You&#39;re a reverser :grin:!

---
## Usage
Download the tool [here](https://exelab.ru/f/index.php?action=vthread&amp;forum=3&amp;topic=20686); it doesn&#39;t have to get installed. Now just run the [loader](https://mega.nz/#!igRQFCjD!n-D7vEIKEhZHtUY5ZogP5HMgv98mdMaWpGKexOlclpQ) from last time and open MegaDumper:

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/1/1f860d7e2212e43e671fafd6aafae91b6957492b.PNG&quot; width=&quot;384&quot; height=&quot;82&quot;&gt;

Just select the application you want to dump, open the context menu and click on .Net dump. Yes, it&#39;s that low... Finally open the newly created folder &quot;Dumps&quot; and search for the dumped executable. You&#39;ll find more than one but I&#39;m sure you&#39;re clever enough to figure out which one&#39;s the right :wink:.

---
## Conclusion
This time a **very** small introduction about .Net dumping for losers. But anybody appreciates some help when he&#39;s working on a heavy case, so I think this tool perfectly suits into our arsenal :smile:. Again I recommend you to try breaking the remaining defenses of the CrackMe on your own for learning by doing. Nothing helps better with understanding something :slight_smile:.
