    <title>Nmap: My Favorite Scan</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/nmap-my-favorite-scan/513</link>
    <description>Besides Social Engineering, recon is by far the most important aspect of hacking. Without recon, all the greatest hackers of our time probably wouldn&#39;t be able to hack anything. Besides, just shoving one exploit after another, when there are thousands of exploits in Metasploit alone, is inefficient.

This tutorial will cover the very basics of `nmap`. It is of my favorite tools to use, mainly in preparation for mischief. Anyway, without knowing how to use `nmap`, there is not much we can do; so, please sit back and read on.

----
# Usage

I&#39;m not going to go into much detail about the tool in general, that&#39;s what the [website](https://nmap.org/) is for. Instead I&#39;ll go right into commands:

`nmap -sS -A -T sneaky &lt;IP&gt;`

This combination is my favorite combination to use, but what exactly is going on here?

    nmap  has to be at the beginning of every Nmap command. 

    -sS, you could use -sN but that&#39;s not ideal because your target can detect that type of scan easier.

    -A This command flag puts several different functions into one, like: Os, operating system, VPNs, etc.

    -T allows you to set the speed at which the packets are sent.

The reason for `-T` is that some servers have a threshold of how many packets can be sent at once; if you pass the threshold, you&#39;re pretty much are caught. There are several speeds, but the one I use the most often is `polite` because I like to be a gentleman to my target. 

And, of course, type in the IP address of your target at the end of the command.

----
#Conclusion

Welp, as the title says, that&#39;s my favorite scan. I hope this would at least start the Recon section a little bit since Recon is so important. My next post would be less personal and more serious. 

Anyway, chow. :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Yup slowing the scan down a lot is important to help prevent detection from an IDS, and other such things.</p>
<p>I generally add -V to help me see how its doing though.</p>

            <p>This is nice. I generally just shove nmap -Pn -A</p>
<p>But to control the speed to void detection is smart.</p>
