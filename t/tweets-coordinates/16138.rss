    <title>Tweets coordinates</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/tweets-coordinates/16138</link>
    <description>Hello, I was wondering if anyone knows any way to get the coordinates of where a Tweet was published, I am doing a kind of Crawler with Ruby and I have run into that problem and I can not find a source where it is explained, no matter if the method that they are going to explain to me is using the Twitter API or using xpath, or another way that they can teach me. I would be eternally grateful for your help.</description>
