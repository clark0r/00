    <title>Need guidance for mobile security</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/need-guidance-for-mobile-security/18447</link>
    <description>Hi everyone. I am new &#39;script kiddie&#39; in this info sec world. Currently exploring &#39;mobile security&#39;. 
I have tried some books and blogs. But I am not understanding well by this. There are some good online course but I can not afford to buy them now.

Can anyone recommend any video tutorial (freely available) for &#39;mobile security&#39; ?

As a new student, it becomes hard sometime to find a good resource. That&#39;s why asking for expert help.

Thanks.</description>
