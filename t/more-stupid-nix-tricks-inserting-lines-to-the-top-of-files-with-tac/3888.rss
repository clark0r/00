    <description>## Why do you do this, fraq?

Occasionally I&#39;ll encounter myself doing something in Linux I don&#39;t do very often and I know other people aren&#39;t doing much as well. When that happens, I try to document the stupid, quirky things I did. Maybe for posterity, maybe because I need a life, I dunno.

## What is the stupid trick today?

Every once in a blue moon, I have to inject a line at the top of a file. Sometimes it&#39;s an `import` statement in python, sometimes it&#39;s a shebang line. While it&#39;s easy to just `vim ./filename` and add it that way, it&#39;s more fun to try to do it programmatically. I&#39;ve seen a few solutions using `sed`, but I&#39;d like to introduce a less popular tool: `tac`

`tac` reads files, but from bottom to top, moving the opposite direction of its cousin, `cat`. You might have even noticed that `tac` is just `cat` backwards. Clever, eh? `tac` doesn&#39;t get much attention, but this is one instance in which its actually useful.

Let&#39;s imagine you want to add an import statement at the top of a python script because you forgot it.

```
# useless_script.py
print(os.environ[&#39;PWD&#39;])
```

This won&#39;t work without `import os` at the top, so let&#39;s add it.

`tac useless_script.py &gt; useless_script.tmp; echo &quot;import os&quot; &gt;&gt; useless_script.tmp &amp;&amp; tac useless_script.tmp &gt; useless_script.py &amp;&amp; rm -f useless_script.tmp`

Now, would it have been easier to use `sed`? Almost certainly. Is this fun? I think so. Will you find a use for this? Yes, when you least expect it.</description>

            <p>You’re right, I actually don’t. I deploy my app stack on ECS and occasionally ssh into my bastion servers to kick off a load test. I rarely ever SSH into the docker hosts. If I do, it’s because something very wrong has happened.</p>
<p>I probably log into the AWS console 1-2 times a week. Most of the time I authenticate over the CLI and just rip things that way.</p>

            <p>Immutable infrastructure baby. If it breaks just reinitialise it. I bet fraq barely ssh’s in to his infra anymore. Ansible, packer and docker do that sort of stuff.</p>

<p>I’m looking at this like <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/_py">@_py</a> does as well.<br>
These nifty little tricks and knowledge bombs  for certain tools, or other methods to automate things are good to know.<br>
So getting a digest of what you can do every now and would really be appreciated !</p>

            <p>Believe it or not my lack of knowledge on the topics you’re good at actually slows down my pwning process a <strong>ton</strong>. Your posts would be much appreciated by the community. Proper workflow is key to productivity and you definitely know about that.</p>

            <p>Ugh I read about tac somewhere before, used it once and forgot about it again…</p>
<p>So I’m appreciating this post/ start of a new series, since it’s a nice change of the otherwise ‘somewhat serious’ real talk topics <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
