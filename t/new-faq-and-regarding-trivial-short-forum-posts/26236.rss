    <description># :hash:  Announcement

Recently, there has been a large influx of new forum threads consisting of trivial questions that have either been answered multiple times on the forum or on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/psA5u3XGFt). These posts are just not fit for the forum in its current form. We, the Moderators will actively unlist any new threads of that kind popping up. If you&#39;re still not content with the present answers provided on a repeating topic on here, feel free to engage in a healthy and civilized discussion about it on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/psA5u3XGFt). Chances of you getting a fitting reply in a more timely manner there are way higher anyway ;) .

For all the basic needs, here is a non-exhaustive FAQ that may get extended over time.

* :fast_forward:  Is this, to my best ability, clear, readable and understandable?
* :fast_forward: Would I publish this in a magazine?
* :fast_forward: If this is a question, would this be better suited for PM or Discord?
