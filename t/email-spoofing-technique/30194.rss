    <title>Email Spoofing technique</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/email-spoofing-technique/30194</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m new to cybersecurity and hacking. Lately I&#39;ve encountered a type of &quot;attack&quot; in my opinion very interesting and I would like to understand more. The attack in question takes the name of &quot;Email Spoofing&quot; and it consists in being able to send an email to a certain address using a &quot;fake&quot; one. When I saw the attack, the &quot;hacker&quot; was able to send an e-mail from the same address of the recipient. I&#39;ve looked for a bit on the internet and I saw solutions that used SET (kali linux) and an external service like smtp server, but they don&#39;t seem to work. I would like to know if anyone knows anything more, Thanks.</description>
