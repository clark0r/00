    <description>This just popped in my twitter, and it looks like something interesting for the kindof forgotten HW section.

It is based on an Arduino, a GSM modem and a small NRF board for the wireless sniffing. All that packed in a standard USB charger case. All the code is available in gihub.

Even when it is a bit old, I think it is a great example of HW hacking. Take a look to the code to figure out how some stuff work... how to send data via an old GSM modem, sniff RF signals,...</description>

            <p>Pretty cool idea! I thought of community projects in other fields as well because we are currently a group of nice guys.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a> you’d think it would be interesting to kick off a <em>community</em> project involving HW?.. Maybe start with something simpler that this keylogger and go further step by step</p>

            <p>Looks like it would be tough to fit all that stuff in there! It would probably require to build an ad-hoc GSM board</p>

            <p>I saw it on mine as well. Looks really cool! I think a computer power cable would be a cool disguise</p>
