    <title>New XSS challenge</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/new-xss-challenge/13847</link>
    <description>Hey there 0x00sec! ðŸ‘‹

Intigriti just launched a couple days ago a new XSS challenge. This time they are celebrating 5k followers on twitter.

The objective is the same as the last one: try to find a DOM XSS in the following page [challenge.intigriti.io/2](https://challenge.intigriti.io)

The challenge ends May 24th. Among all accepted solutions, a winner will be picked. The prize is the same, you can check it in the link above.

Since this time I have a couple days before the challenge ends, Iâ€™ll try to write the solution and post it here once it finishes.

Hope you enjoy it!

See you around,
