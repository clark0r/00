    <title>We&#39;ve had our first donation!</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/weve-had-our-first-donation/255</link>
    <description>This morning I opened up my laptop, logged in, checked the Bitcoin wallet, and VIOLA, a kind individual has seen our fine platform, liked what we&#39;re doing, and decided to donate **0.0049 BTC**! All donations will be used in the running and development of the server. 

Thank you kind person ;) We appreciate it a lot :slight_smile: 

If anybody else wants to help keep our site on its feet, our BTC address is 1Hp1p87sryWfNd5jsVCMq5bK8zztUTsndx

If you&#39;d like to use PayPal, then we can provide one. However I&#39;m not sure how much demand there would be? Comment if you would like to donate with PayPal and we can make it happen! 

Thanks!
