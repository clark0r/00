    <title>Raspberry Pry - Offline Communications Network</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/raspberry-pry-offline-communications-network/1497</link>
    <description>Picture the moment. It&#39;s 2057, technology has barely progressed, and the earth is under harsh censorship and surveillance. Humanity has reverted to the Hitler days. 

Don&#39;t get depressed! Let&#39;s build a mesh net!

In your manic mindset, you quickly through together your portable phone re-charger, your Raspberry Pi Model B &lt;small&gt; (YES I AM USING A MODEL B @Suser)&lt;/small&gt;, and your Alfa AWUS036NH Network Card. You stuff it in a folder and admire your hardware 1337&#39;ness. &lt;small&gt;@anon79434934&lt;/small&gt;.

&quot;Sweet!&quot; - You remark.

Don&#39;t get too excited, it may look awesome but it doesn&#39;t actually do anything yet...

You fire up dd and write that SD card with raspbian, then you boot up and SSH in. After the usual, and updates, you install the packages you will need.

```
sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server dnsmasq hostapd inspircd
```

First you check your network device is recognised

```
lsusb | grep &#39;Wireless&#39;
```

```
&gt;&gt; Bus 001 Device 005: ID 148f:3070 Ralink Technology, Corp. RT2870/RT3070 Wireless Adapter

```


## Interfaces

`sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces`
```text
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
  address 10.0.1.2
  netmask 255.255.255.0
```

## Hostapd

`sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf`
```text
interface=wlan0
ssid=0x00sec
channel=6
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
wpa=3
wpa_passphrase=0x00secIsBae
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
```


## DHCP

`sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcp.conf`
```text
ddns-update-style none;

default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;

authoritative;

log-facility local7;

subnet 10.0.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
 range 10.0.1.10 10.0.1.254;
 option broadcast-address 10.0.1.255;
 option routers 10.0.1.2;
 default-lease-time 600;
 max-lease-time 7200;
 option domain-name-servers 10.0.1.2;
}

```

Enable your services

```
sudo systemctl enable hostapd
sudo systemctl enable isc-dhcp-server
sudo systemctl enable dnsmsq
```

Do a cheeky reboot and then we can get to configuring the exciting things! If you check your wifi networks, there should be a network called 0x00sec protected by WPA2. Connect to it and hopefully you should get an IP. You will notice though that even if your PI is plugged in via ethernet, you aren&#39;t getting any connection. 

This is because you haven&#39;t configured iptables to route your data, and you don&#39;t have a DNS server! Remember how we installed dnsmasq earlier? Lets Configure that baby!

## Dnsmasq

`sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf`
```text
domain-needed
interface=wlan0
no-dhcp-interface=wlan0
```

`sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq`

## Routing

Enable IP Forwarding

```
sudo sh -c &quot;echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward&quot;
```

Now iptables routing
 
```
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wlan0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
```

On your network now, you should get both an IP, and be able to access the internet on your device. But these rules won&#39;t persist cross boot, so lets fix that. 

```
sudo sh -c &quot;iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat&quot;
```

Now let&#39;s open up that interfaces file again

```
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```
and append this line
```text
up iptables-restore &lt; /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat
```

Cool, now we can configure IRC, or whatever else we want on the Pi, in my case I configured IRC and KiwiIRC.  You can equally set up a tor proxy, or some sort of message board. The beauty of this is that it is completely offline, and you will instantly share any ethernet internet connection over wifi. 

People can set up repeaters for this network, and this starts as a beautiful beginning for a mesh network. The other ideal part of this is that it is portable, you can take it anywhere, and allow people to connect. Now you have successfully thrawted the evil opressors, and saved humanity! 

Personally I find this is very useful for hotels that only provide a single ethernet port. Heck, you could even connect a harddrive and install plexmediaserver on this baby. Portable Media Streamer! The possibilities are endless!

I hope this helped! FIGHT THE POWER. 

Make sure to tell me what you thought about it, and what you would do or have done with a raspberry pi in the past? I am really interested to hear about your projects!

            <aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>In wireless networking, Ad-Hoc is one of the modes of operation for an 802.11 radio. It happens at OSI layer 1, the physical layer, and it basically means that all devices can communicate directly to any other device that is within radio range. Normally, in Infrastructure mode, wireless devices can only communicate with a central Access Point or Router and that device is responsible for re-transmitting packets from one client device to another client device (even if they are right next to each other). Ad-Hoc networks get rid of the middle-man that is the AP, however they don’t have any inherent capability for multi-hop. That means, if device A can reach device B, and device B can reach device C, but A cannot reach C, then A and C cannot communicate because B will not re-transmit any packets.</p>
<p>Mesh Networking, also know as Mesh Routing happens at OSI layer 3, the network layer. Mesh Routing allows each device on a network (also called nodes) to act as a router and re-transmit packets on behalf of any other devices. Mesh Routing provide the multi-hop facility that Ad-Hoc mode lacks. By combining Ad-Hoc mode at layer 1 and Mesh Routing at layer 3 we can create wireless mesh networks purely between client devices without any need for centralized Access Points or Routers.</p>
<p>P2P or Peer-to-Peer simply means that clients talk directly to each other without the use of a central server. Both Ad-Hoc and Mesh Routing can be described as P2P as they are both instances of clients-to-client communication, just at different layers of the OSI model</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Straight outta superuser, It seems that a mesh network is what we would be looking at.</p>

            <p>Perhaps you could develop a dhcp system that creates an address based off of a hash of the mac address.  That way verification is trivial on all hosts.  As for DNS it could operate exactly the same.</p>
