    <title>Asemica - An asemic Markov-chained cipher</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/asemica-an-asemic-markov-chained-cipher/1798</link>
    <description>This is a cool tool i found,thought i would share it with everyone-It&#39;s called Asemica.

Definition: Asemica is a symmetric cipher whose key is a document and whose ciphertext looks like plaintext. 

**Why use this?**
One of the downsides of encrypting messages and emails is that few people are doing it,you will stick out like a sore thumb to anyone who is monitoring the data.
For example, it&#39;d be pretty easy to filter out all messages that contain PGP headers.

So,we use a cipher text which looks like plaintext,This plain text can be combined with PGP for added security.</description>

<p>This is a little better implemented though…</p>
