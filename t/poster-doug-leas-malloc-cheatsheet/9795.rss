    <description>Hey there! First post, finally! :smiley:

First of all, thanks to &quot;W&quot; (calling him W just in case he doesn&#39;t want his &#39;name&#39; revealed) and to Leeky for the help! My poster looked like a mess before they helped me &lt;333

I was studying Doug Lea&#39;s malloc() vulnerability and, to keep track of some concepts, I wrote them down and ended up with tables and flowcharts.
Seeing it was pretty helpful to me and also kinda cute, I redid it in a poster format to put it up so I can remember that stuff.

I&#39;m sharing the pic I did with you so maybe it&#39;s useful in case you are learning about dlmalloc, you want to or simply because you like it (hopefully!).

Adding a link to a tweet I made with an image in PNG format: https://twitter.com/eightytank/status/1067174846986108928 Just in case you&#39;re feeling like giving me love today.
Also, it&#39;s in my tweet too but adding it here. My blog post about it with the image in GIF format: https://hackingsquid.blogspot.com/2018/11/poster-doug-leas-malloc-cheatsheet-heap.html There are a tad more of details there, like references and stuff.

If you happen to find some concept that&#39;s wrong, please send me a message and let me know so I can edit! Thanks a lot :relaxed:![HeapOverflow|689x462](upload://cVy8lsOXGDjffRDDMkIbAuDNAiJ.png)</description>

            <p>Here is a bit more detailed flowchart: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudburst/libheap/master/heap.png" rel="nofollow noopener">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudburst/libheap/master/heap.png</a><br>
Although I’m pretty sure it’s a bit outdated (no tcache here iirc).</p>
<p>PS: I’m not the author, just sharing a link.</p>
