    <title>OSINT - Lamprey</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/osint-lamprey/19477</link>
    <description>Hello everyone.

I was doing some volunteer work recently and there was a situation which involved performing a rather large number of Google searches for cross-referencing purposes and potential leak identification. The concept of performing &gt;20k queries manually didn&#39;t appeal.

I&#39;ve created a small tool ([Lamprey](https://www.pedro-nunes.net/?p=562)) to do the heavy lifting for me. Takes in N lists of queries, performs a combinatorial expansion and outputs a summary and the top 10 results for any matching hits. The outputs are in .csv so it can be analysed further in other programs.

However, one thing I wanted to point out the community towards is that Google offers US$300 in credit with their platform. I&#39;ve written a document on how to set up a [Custom Search Engine in the project&#39;s wiki](https://gitlab.com/hostile.node/lamprey/-/wikis/Custom-Search-Engine-setup), which you can leverage for other projects. It&#39;s just a JSON API, so once it is set up it is quite straightforward to use.

GPL as usual, source&#39;s here: https://gitlab.com/hostile.node/lamprey

Hopefully of use to someone.
