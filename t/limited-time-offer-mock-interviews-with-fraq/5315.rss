    <title>Limited Time Offer: Mock Interviews With Fraq</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/limited-time-offer-mock-interviews-with-fraq/5315</link>
    <description>So many of us here are looking for work or interviewing for jobs. Others of us have plenty of experience interviewing or being interviewed. Let&#39;s put those skills together and make our community better!

I&#39;m going to lead from the front here by sharing a link where you can subscribe to my calendar and schedule a mock interview. I have limited availability and I travel a good bit, but if you see a free slot on there, it&#39;s yours to grab! The calendar makes sure I don&#39;t double-book or overcommit by limiting the number of appointments I can take, so don&#39;t feel guilty.

I will sit with you for a 30 minute session and we&#39;ll go through a mock interview where I&#39;ll ask a handful of technical and workplace related questions and give you an opportunity to do the same. And of course, you&#39;ll get feedback as well.

I can&#39;t pretend to be the greatest in the world (or even an expert), but hopefully this helps you work out some of your nerves and get a practice round in before the real-deal.

## How to schedule a mock interview with me

1. Go to https://calendly.com/fraq/30min
2. Pick a time slot, let me know who you are, what position you&#39;re interviewing for, and include a link to or copy of your resume
4. Join the `#mock-interviews` voice channel in the [0x00sec Discord server](https://discord.gg/chgxjZy) some time before the meeting and make sure your sound setup works.
3. Show up and show up prepared. The better prepared you are, the more we&#39;ll both get out of it. I&#39;ll be preparing too.</description>
