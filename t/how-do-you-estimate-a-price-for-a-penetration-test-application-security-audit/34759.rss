    <title>How do you estimate a price for a penetration test/application security audit?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/how-do-you-estimate-a-price-for-a-penetration-test-application-security-audit/34759</link>
    <description>Hello guys,
I have been trying for some time to figure out what is a good way to estimate a &quot;fair&quot; price for a penetration testing activity. I&#39;ve searched online quite a bit, and everyone always says the same thing: consider timing, number of dynamic pages/endpoints/api, etc. 
However, I haven&#39;t found &quot;standard&quot; numerics or practical examples to take inspiration from.

So in case you are also involved (or have been involved in the past) in determining prices for your pentest/appsec activities, how did you estimate it?

 Thanks :blush:</description>

            <p>Hello guys,<br>
I have been trying for some time to figure out what is a good way to estimate a “fair” price for a penetration testing activity. I’ve searched online quite a bit, and everyone always says the same thing: consider timing, number of dynamic pages/endpoints/api, etc.<br>
However, I haven’t found “standard” numerics or practical examples to take inspiration from.</p>
<p>So in case you are also involved (or have been involved in the past) in determining prices for your pentest/appsec activities, how did you estimate it?</p>
