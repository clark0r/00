    <title>OSINT websites for passive recon</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/osint-websites-for-passive-recon/1147</link>
    <description>Hi all, recently I have come across a couple of Open-Source Intel websites that I have come to find quite useful.  I do not know how old or common they are but I have just recently found them;

[https://www.punkspider.org](https://www.punkspider.org) - is a web application vulnerability search engine that scans for seven of the biggest web app vulnerabilities and puts the results into a search-able archive.

[https://www.censys.io](https://www.censys.io) - is basically the same as shodan but a little more technical.

And in case there are any new newbies who do not already know, [www.shodan.io](http://www.shodan.io) is a great website to find new targets and perform passive recon.
- If anyone else has any other goodies please follow up, thanks
