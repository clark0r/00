    <title>How do you think malware authors will adapt to AI/ML based Anti-Virus detection?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/how-do-you-think-malware-authors-will-adapt-to-ai-ml-based-anti-virus-detection/17316</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not knowledgable at all at how current AV works, but from what I can gather, the majority of AV vendor detection methods do not flag programs based on general behavior. Rather, they rely on signatures and  heuristics.

AI/ML based techniques flag based on how the malware behaves, so simple changes in the codebase will have little to no power on detection rates. 

I wonder now: how will the malware authors of the future adapt to this?</description>

            <p>So will look at the signature of Polymorphic code, the code base changes but the algorithm keeps the same pattern. Now with neural-network type AI. This proves to be a challenge, since it understands that all it has to do is change, signature,algorithm - You now have a scenario that you have to combat the situation with AI aswell, but the sole purpose of your AI is to track/monitor what the bad AI is doing and looking for a pattern in its behavior.</p>
