Okay, so I&#39;ve tried out Parrot, and have come to a conclusion with it. (on the look, feel, and comprehensiveness of it)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Pros:**
1.) A great amount of tools come pre-installed, and there are thousands 
more to download in their repositories should you have need to download 
one of them. (need a tool, i.e. snort, then just do &quot;apt-get install 
snort&quot; and you&#39;re good to go)
2.) The theme of Parrot is sleek, and easy to navigate. Perfect for a hacking NewB
3.) Has everything right where you need it. The menus are beautifully Organized. Absolutely wonderfully so.
4.) Widgets are very handy and easy to read
5.) I love the color scheme for everything
6.) Doesn&#39;t even need a GPU to run! (I can easily put this on my Dell Inspiron 600m)
7.) Comes with anonymization services you can enable with one mouse click. (anon surf)

**Cons:**
1.) Must download important tools (such as snort) from repositories
2.)Not minimalistic out of box, although that can be changed with a few GUI tweaks and a different wallpaper.
3.) Out of Box desktop is somewhat cluttered with shortcuts. (6 to be precise)

This OS is my preferred Hacking Operating System.
