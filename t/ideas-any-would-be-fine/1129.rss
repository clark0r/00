    <description>I haven&#39;t been on that much ever since my laptop was getting fixed but I am currently working on modifying a worm and once it is done in a few months I will post it on here. Although, at the moment I am at lost with what tuorials to do. I was thinking maybe Raspberry Pi tutorials but I would love to hear from the community for ideas. I am not abandoning my current series but at the moment I am not able to do much except research. Cheers.</description>

            <p>Python isn’t exactly my programming language. I code in C and C++, but I started learning Python a while back because the Pi is coded in Python. I could possibly look into it because Python was built from C and I’ve seen the code which is very similar to C. Other than that, thanks for the suggestions.</p>

            <p>You wouldn’t like a post from me on how the Linux command-line works <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/scream.png?v=9" title=":scream:" class="emoji" alt=":scream:"></p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/0x00pf">@0x00pf</a> I plan to do a short series on the introduction of offensive security which will cover passive &amp; active recon, exploitation, and maintaining access, so new people can follow. I will however not talk about more advanced topics like how the Linux command line works (not in detail atleast, I will teach basic commands like “cd” and “cat”) or scripting. This could be something you or <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/valentine">@Valentine</a> might be willing to cover then?</p>

            <p>How about we focus on more basic stuff for the new people? Perhaps you can do some tuts on that?</p>
