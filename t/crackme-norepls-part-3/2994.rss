    <title>[CrackMe] NoREpls - Part 3</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/crackme-norepls-part-3/2994</link>
    <description># Backstory
`edgyReggie` is very thankful for those very, very, very few people (probably his parents :sweat_smile:) who bought him some coffee to get him through his days in university. As a means of saying _Thanks!_, he has implemented something that shows the customer&#39;s name on the software after it has been registered. Something that&#39;s really been frustrating him is how people keep managing to tamper with his serial numbers so hardcoding them is no longer an option and believes that his new validation method will be harder with which to mess around. The more complex the validation, the harder to crack, right? But by the looks of things, he&#39;s in a state of conflict and has doubts that just changing the verification method will not be enough to stop crackers from pirating his software...

## Difficulty

#### Author Assigned Level: Newbie

#### Community Assigned Level:
[poll type=regular]
* Newbie
* Wannabe
* Hacker
* Wizard
* Guru
[/poll]

----------
## Goal
* Your goal is to achieve the &quot;full&quot; version of the software, i.e. removing all nags that you see and unlocking all features of the program.
* Your secondary (optional) goal is to generate a working name-serial pair if possible.
* Bonus points to the most elegant solutions (minimal byte patching).


----------
## Rules of Engagement
None.

            <p>I’m a bit late here but I thought this would be interesting to add. I looked into the serial checking code as well and it seems that the serial check completely ignores the contents of the given serial. It only performs a ton of complicated operations on the username. It ends up putting the result of these operations in the ebx register. The ebx register is then compared with an arbitrary number. When ebx is larger than that number, the registration is successful. So, as long as the serial has the correct format, everything is fine. The only  thing that matters is if the username is correct. At least, this is what I found after digging around in the code. It could very well be that I missed something very obvious.</p>
