    <title>Which Linux Distribution for a Relative Beginner?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/which-linux-distribution-for-a-relative-beginner/524</link>
    <description>Hey Mates,
as I said before, I want to install a new Linux distro. The only problem is that I don&#39;t know which one I should chose :grin:. Maybe some of you can recommend me one.
I search one that is a demanding but not too hard for a Linux starter. Thanks in advance!

            <p>Thanks to all! I think I’ll start with MINT and when it’s not what I search for I’ll just use Ubuntu <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">. When I have more time I’ll take a look at Debian!</p>

            <p>Indeed you can follow a bottom-up or a top-down approach. That is up to you. My understanding is that <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/thedoctor">@TheDoctor</a> is looking into GNU/Linux to keep working on his crackmes as consequence of the outcome of <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/what-os-do-you-use-win-linux-mac/494">the poll he posted some days ago</a>.</p>
<p>In that context, my guess is that he wants something up and running to do his stuff… Getting to know how to fully configure a Linux box may not be an immediate objective. Some people don’t want to become sysadmins.</p>
<p>Maybe that was quite an assumption.</p>
<p>Said that, I have to admit that Debian is my preferred distro <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Hope these different points of view may help <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/thedoctor">@TheDoctor</a> to make its own decision! <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>

<p>I thought of installing it around three years ago while I was getting started with Linux through puTTY, but I never got around to installing it.</p>

            <p>True. It definitely speeds up the climatization to Linux.</p>

            <p>I disagree actually <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Although I believe that every Linux n00b should start with a Debian based OS, I don’t think that Ubuntu is the best one to start with, firstly because of those cringeworthy themes the stock one ships with and secondly because it’s too stable.</p>
<p>A Linux n00b should learn how to fix problems when they happen and how to install packages that are not in the repos, so I actually suggest starting with a minimal build of Debian and building the kind of OS you want out of it.</p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>
