### [Realistic challenge 10](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/10/)

#### Message:
&gt;hey man, it&#39;s me Zach, I need a favor from you, I&#39;m in big trouble.
if you&#39;ll remember, I go to that super uptight religious school. well, two of my teachers are failing me because my lifestyle does not fall in line with their moralistic rules for public behavior. My gym teacher even called me a &#39;long-haired hippie faggot&#39;! And if I fail any classes, I won&#39;t graduate.
Listen, can you hack into the school&#39;s grade database and make it so I&#39;m passing all my classes? I know they have this system set up on their website that allows teachers to submit grades and stuff, and I heard you pulled a few things in the past as well. Their web master was not thinking in terms of computer security when he was designing the website, so it might be easy. Or not. Please check it out here. The user name to my account is &#39;Zach Sanchez&#39; and my password is &#39;liberty638&#39;. Thanks man!


#### What can we extract from the message?

* theres a database
* teacher have a grade submit system
* we have a user login Zach Sanchez/liberty638


### The site:


&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/4988490908ba2f297167f440c88bcbf14a28f6fd.png&quot; width=&quot;636&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;

* A bunch of links to follow. 
* We have a student login
* We have a teacher login
* We have a staff list with names and email addresses


### The source

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/0/095a4b71089d388d8efe585381d2fac5b5881bf3.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;338&quot;&gt;


### The &#39;hack&#39;
[spoiler]

Ok so what are we gonna do here?

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/7/758234b9c35fa88988b2b43ad35d4c9e62276adf.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;86&quot;&gt;
We saw at the source theres a &#39;hidden&#39; staff.php.
When we want to access it we need a login and a password.

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/0/03e587b207b80a29e648daeb64487667b8329e66.png&quot; width=&quot;462&quot; height=&quot;221&quot;&gt;

We could try to use some form SQL injection..
Or even better! Wait for this..
Let&#39;s check the staff list!
We got their email addresses.

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/d/d601667c974c1016e7fd1c0bb98de889eba9b694.png&quot; width=&quot;286&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;

So most likely the handle before the @ will be the corresponding username!
So we have to guess a password now...
How about we just use the username as a password as well, because why not?
People always use shit passwords...

&gt; entering credentials:  smiller/smiller

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/f/f8dd34e7d17b0c0b1f1c0a8d4bb9800ec10c768a.png&quot; width=&quot;641&quot; height=&quot;147&quot;&gt;

And we see we got a login..


But what is that?
We need &quot;holy_browser&quot;? Wtf man..
Let&#39;s do some identity faking. This can be done e.g. through a simple firefox addon called [user agent switcher](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/)
If you know any other tools or  strategies for this let me now!

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/b2aaddb9a819aaab1f2bed9c42bccbcdc0d3586a.png&quot; width=&quot;326&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;


Again.. another problem arose...
We cannot change grades because we are no admin?!

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/6/6de2b406ae76ff9b8c4c51d654b588f9e2ce0233.png&quot; width=&quot;648&quot; height=&quot;321&quot;&gt;

Let&#39;s check the user cookie :) 
And there it is an admin cookie :D.. flip it to &#39;1&#39;..

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/0/05627e3ba30092bfff279bfede042565e4736cb6.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;54&quot;&gt;

Ok now we can change grades. Let&#39;s do it for our buddy Zach.

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/6/63fc63aac17f7ed246bcb38a4bcdb5c72215897a.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;475&quot;&gt;

Meh. The rating period is over it seems.
Head to the batmobile... ehm source code and see what&#39;s going on here.
The submit button to modify got commented out :( ...

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/b0e68169309b95950bd0336782ad0a52d7c00e62.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;104&quot;&gt;

Welp idc. So let&#39;s forge our own request to the site to update the grade.
If we look at our URL right now we already have some parameters set. 
We can leave them as is or copy the URL chunk from the source.
So let&#39;s look at the classes which need some change.
Copy the URL and add the necessary pieces.
Which are:

* grade=
* comment= (optional)

Result: 
&gt;.../staff.php?action=changegrades&amp;changeaction=modrec&amp;rec=3&amp;studentid=1&amp;grade=5&amp;comments=TOPKEK

So we just custom tailor our URL request for the grades we want to change and are done..

[/spoiler]


# Conclusions
This time around we had some combination of cookie forgery, login credential stealing, and URL forgery.
This challenge aimed at being a small pain in the bumhole with all these small obstacles, but in the end not much tools and knowledge were necessary to solve those. 
The next article of the series can be found [here](https://0x00sec.org/t/hts-org-r11-challenge/) once it&#39;s up!!

            <p>Hi ricksanchez! Hope you’re ok.</p>
<p>I read a lot of your contributions and it was a true pleasure to read your interview. I admire your skills and I wonder if you can help us. I have the same problem of Zach-hope you don’t judge me, it’s a long story-</p>
<p>(Sorry if I post it here, but don’t figure out how to send a private message).</p>
