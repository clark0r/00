    <title>Sockets Exploits</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/sockets-exploits/34200</link>
    <description>As I dive deeper into **networking**, I&#39;ve been exploring ways to integrate it with C programming. After several hours of work, I was able to create a TCP chat application using the sockets library. Recently, I came across a podcast where a speaker discussed using socket exploits to perform actions such as opening a client&#39;s CD/DVD tray. Although it was just a brief mention, I find this aspect of &quot;exploit coding&quot; fascinating and want to learn more.

Do you know of any resources that cover socket exploits? *(Or anything related to networking exploits that could be done using C)* **As someone who is comfortable with C, I would like to stick to it while exploring this topic.** 

I have already completed some interesting projects using C and have a pretty knowledge about how network actually works, **but I&#39;m not sure exactly what to do with it** and I&#39;m excited to see what possibilities exploit coding may offer.</description>
