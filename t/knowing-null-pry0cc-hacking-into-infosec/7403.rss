    <description>## Welcome back to Knowing Null
Knowing Null is a series of interviews randomly conducted on the 0x00sec IRC server and compiled here for your convenience. Today’s guest is the ever present pry0cc!

## But, first, a poll! Who do you want to see next time?
[poll type=regular max=7]
* fraq
* dtm
* ricksanchez
* zSec
* sprtn
* 0x00pf
* Phoenix750
[/poll]

**1: Aight, so first off, can you tell me a bit about yourself, your infosec work, etc?**

&gt; Sure
&gt; I love infosec, and for work I primarily do pentesting, vulnerability scanning, consulting and a fair amount of R &amp; D
&gt; this involves testing new attack methods and developing inhouse tools related to our work

**2: What brought you into infosec? How&#39;d you get your start?**

&gt; Well for the longest period I was into development and systems administration
&gt; I did that as a hobby for about 3 years, and then I fell in love with Linux
&gt; Naturally, I started to become familiar with people who were involved in infosec (funnily enough through Google+), and I was curious about what you can actually do
&gt; When I first began demystifying everything I was shocked how methods still worked

**3: What was your first hack?**

&gt; Hmmm... I think it was probably some sort of MITM. I was a skid who had managed to install dsploit on android, and I felt so clever when I replaced images and created alert boxes on peoples mobile devices

**4: Do you have a degree?**

&gt; Nope!
&gt; That&#39;s 3 years I didn&#39;t have time to waste
&gt; However
&gt; I have watched all the CS50 videos

**5: What kinda tools do you typically work with now?**

&gt; Tools? Well mainly koadic and empire. We have a few in-house things we use, but I&#39;m not allowed to speak about those :)
&gt; If you&#39;re talking about shells
&gt; I&#39;m using hashicorp packer, docker and kubernetes a lot for related things

**6: do you do any sort of programming?**

&gt; All the time!
&gt; Bash, Ruby, Python, PHP. For libraries sinatra creeps its way in sometimes.
&gt; Mainly automating things we do
&gt; nokogiri is love too

**7: for the pen-testing, vuln scanning, R&amp;D, what areas would you advise an upcoming hacker to focus on?**

&gt; An upcoming hacker? If they want to do it professionally?
&gt; Hmmm
&gt; I want to say: advice for people who are hobbyists and want to get into the industy
&gt; Realize, to get an entry level job in security, you don&#39;t need to be as good as you think you do
&gt; At least that was my problem
&gt; I always thought that I had to be this amazing god-level hacker
&gt; When you enter the industry, you realize that as long as you are happy to learn, getting an entry level job in security requires less knowledge than you&#39;d expect
&gt; I would say, learn the buzzwords, SOW, NDA, CVA, PCI compliance, HIPPA
&gt; Learn security, and do CTF&#39;s
&gt; And contribute to online communities like 0x00sec.org, and put them on your resume

**8: Do you have a favorite CTF?**

&gt; I really like the hackthebox.eu CTF&#39;s
&gt; I bought a VIP subscription because I love them so much
&gt; The difficult level indications are super useful for beginners
&gt; And they expose you to new exploit scenario&#39;s all the time

**9: What was one of your biggest challenges?**
&gt; 
&gt; Self confidence
&gt; I never thought I was good enough
&gt; Until I said, screw this, I&#39;m gonna work in security if it kills me.
&gt; Then I realised I had more to offer than I ever thought

**10: What&#39;s your favorite linux distro?**

&gt; I didn&#39;t realise I had to say: Arch
&gt; But, ubuntu for servers

**11: What do you do for fun? to kick back?**

&gt; Drive. I love driving, cleaning my car, hitting some nice twisty roads.
&gt; I also like drinking and watching silly movies.
&gt; CTF&#39;s play a part too
&gt; Silly movies like, Die Hard 4

&quot;What do you drive?&quot;

&gt; A Ford Fiesta ST-Line Red Edition
&gt; 1.0 Litre that produces 140 BHP
&gt; It&#39;s a silly fun little hatch
&gt; I plan on modifying it soon :P

**12: What&#39;s color hat do you wear?**

&gt; #DCDCDC

**13: Okay. To tie this all up, is there anything else you&#39;d like to say to the community?**

&gt; YES
&gt; To the entire community: You&#39;re amazing. Keep doing what you&#39;re doing. You creators, you rock, everybody who comments and likes and shows their support by sharing articles and buying swag are so awesome and what make this community what it is
&gt; Because of people like you, we&#39;re able to keep this place awesome and free
&gt; KEEP BEING AWESOME

**Hell yeah. Thanks for your time, pry0cc.**

&gt; ;) np man

            <p>Interesting… interesting indeed. I believe that the ‘hackers’ that don’t have a degree are the most well respected. Btw, clearly I have low esteem so I just crack a dirty joke and I feel better. lololol.</p>

<p>Another thing though, when you finally find your confidence and everything works out. Watch your arrogance. I am guilty of this in recent times so I’m trying my best to bring myself back to earth.</p>
