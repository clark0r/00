Networks:
Tap add button then i typed irc.0x00sec.org
i then tap the edit buttuon 

Servers tab:
tap add and type irc.0x00sec.org/6697
Autojoin channels i added #site-feedback:announcements

Tick the following:

use global user information 
Network

Login method:
custom....(onnect commands)

Then connect 

In the chat bar add the following type this 
/msg NickServ register (password gos here) no brackets either lol

You then add this in to the bar yes type it ```
/msg NickServ identify (password gos here) without the brackets 

Now add this /join #0x00sec enter
