    <title>Useful shell shortcuts</title>

    <description>(Thanks to @oaktree for giving me an idea to start this topic. )

Most of us spend a lot of time in some type of a shell. To save time (and sometimes sanity) it is useful to know some (keyboard) shortcuts which can be pretty darn useful.

So if you know a useful shortcut, and it isn&#39;t already mentioned, drop it below.

---
Notes:

 * ^ is a shorthand for CTRL (control)
 * all shortcuts should work in bash, but are generally shell agnostic (i.e., most will work in other shells, like Cisco iOS)

---
 My most useful shortcuts:

 * ^L = clear; clear the screen of the shell (emulator)
 * ^SHIFT C &amp; ^SHIFT V = copy &amp; paste
   * SHIFT INS = paste
 * ^W = delete the word before the cursor
   * word1 word2| word3 &gt; will delete word2
 * ALT D = delete the word after the cursor
   * word1 |word2 word3 &gt; will delete word2
 * ^U = delete from cursor to the beginning of the line
   * word1 word2| word3 &gt; will delete word2, word1
 * ^A = jump to the beginning of the line (like HOME)
 * ^E = jump to the end of the line (like END)
 * ^LEFT | ^RIGHT = jump between words
 * ^P = scroll through history, from oldest to newest (like UP)
 * ^F = move cursor one char to the right
 * ^H = delete one char behind the cursor
 * ^D = delete one char under the cursor
 * ^O = execute command
 * ^C = terminate running command
 * ^Z = pause running command, return to stdin
  * bg = push paused command to background, resume execution (watch out, command will print to stdout if not otherwise specified)
  * fg = pull paused / backgrounded command &#39;to front&#39;, resume execution if paused
 * ^r = search command history
  * additional ^r = scroll through search results</description>
