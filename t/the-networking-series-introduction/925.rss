    <title>The Networking Series: Introduction</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/the-networking-series-introduction/925</link>
    <description>Hi ! Today I wanted to talk about how networks work. This is probably the first Tutorial of a Networking series. 

___
A lot of people on 0x00sec are good and have decent knowledge ( Programming, Social engineering or Networking ). This series is intended to Newbies and people who want to expand their knowledge in Networking.

# What will I learn ? 

Before you and your Hacktivist Group named **Fr1end** become great hackers and control the world, you have to understand how computer communicate.

In this series, I hope I can bring you some information about TCP/IP OSI Model and more. You&#39;ll see that networking is really cool. Since we&#39;re all interested in Hacking, we will talk about Networking with a Hacker mind.

Here some example of how the Tutorials will be : 

 * The **ARP** Tutorial will talk about how the protocol works. I will cover the  *Man in the middle attack* ( Still effective today against weak protocol : HTTP , Telnet and all unencrypt protocol ) the hard way : forging packet with packet with scapy or/and Raw socket.

 * The How to about **Firewall** will talk about the pro and cons of some configuration and how to evade firewall.

Keep in mind that all Tutorial won&#39;t be writen this way. Some of them will only cover theory.

#Content of the course 
Here is the outline of the Series, if you need a specific tutorial just click on the link below. This post will be update everytime.

- Physical topology and logical topology
- What are these devices ? *Router, Switch, Computer , Hub*
- How computer talk to each other ? *Arp protocol*
- Weakness of the Arp protocol 
- TCP/IP and the OSI Model 
- Weakness of the TCP/IP Protocol 
- You shall not pass : Basic understanding of Firewall, the world of (in)security

Hope you&#39;ll be here for the First Tutorial :) 

Stay safe and Hack back.

            <p>Great initiative mate ! However, did you planned to talk about other protocols than ARP ? Indeed, according to your configuration (LAN / WIFI), several protocols are used e.g. Aloha, CSMA/CA-CD, bitmap protocol, MACAW, etc.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Nitrax</p>
