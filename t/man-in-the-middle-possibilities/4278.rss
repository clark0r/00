    <title>Man in the middle possibilities</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/man-in-the-middle-possibilities/4278</link>
    <description>I&#39;m learning a thing or another about &quot;man in the middle&quot; and I can get the packages of simple sites and I saw that a lot of sites lose the HTTPS flag on my navigator but sites like GMail, Hotmail or Facebook don&#39;t lose it and I can&#39;t see it&#39;s packages. So I got this question:

What other things I can do with &quot;man in the middle&quot;?
Can I get these site&#39;s packages and consequently the POST request with a beautifull login and password?</description>

            <p>So thanks anyway, bro. I’ll move on to another technique and continue my tests. I saw that “man in the middle” is not the tipe of attack that will face a proper https protection. I’ll continue my tests with that social engineering attacks with the hook.js.</p>

            <p>HSTS will stop that. That is one of the problems. You also have an issue with DNS cache.</p>

            <p>You can do a bit with mitmf, and HSTS bypass, although you’ll struggle to MITM sites like Google.</p>
