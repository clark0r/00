    <title>New here, and to pentesting</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/new-here-and-to-pentesting/16680</link>
    <description>Hello! So, as you can probably tell I&#39;m new here. I have taken an interest in pen testing and writing malware. However, I&#39;m really not sure where is the absolute best place to start learning stuff like this.

Really, what I want to learn is basics for Python and getting a pen test lab up and running.

I&#39;m sorry if this seems stupid, or annoying in any way. I&#39;m just a noob trying to learn some stuff before heading into college and uni for it, I think it&#39;s always best to get a beginners track up and running. 

Hopefully someone out there could give some advice. It would be much appreciated.
