    <title>Rrecommendations for Network Tools</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/rrecommendations-for-network-tools/12596</link>
    <description>Hi there,
I recently got employed (first job) as a sysadmin and netadmin at a small company and I was wondering what networking and/or administrative tools I could use that they can help me at my job.

Currently I am using Wireshark to monitor the network and Nmap to check out the machines.
Are there any other tools you would recommend that are helpful?</description>

            <p>That probably largely depends on what kind of network you operate. But in general I’d think the whole range of</p>
<pre><code>snmpwalk &amp; snmpget
</code></pre>
<p>And the like can be useful.</p>
<p>There are a lot of very specific tools that all serve their purpose well but there will be a lot you won’t need as they’re irrelevant for your network.</p>
<p>•  Is it just a normal office environment?<br>
•  What OS are used in the network? Which do you use yourself?<br>
• Are you also responsible for network security?</p>
<p>Knowing this would likely help to answer your question better.</p>
