    <title>HOW do you solve CTF challenges?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/how-do-you-solve-ctf-challenges/37746</link>
    <description>Beginner here,
I have listened to the advice of some in this forum of starting doing the OverTheWire CTF.
Being tackled each level with a new, completely unknown challenge enhances my knowledge a ton!

Though, what should I do when I get stuck? And I mean, truly stuck - for days.
What do you do then? do you get the answer and move on to not waste much time? Or do you have some sort of timing for these situations?

I don&#39;t want to always check for the answers. Is &#39;never-checking&#39; possible? do you recommended it?
I&#39;d love to hear your feedback on this one.</description>
