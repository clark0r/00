    <description>Hey 0x00sec! I&#39;ll be taking a pause from my Data Structures series to introduce this community to Graph Theory with Dijkstra&#39;s Algorithm. I only just barely understand this, so bare with me.

# Graph Theory (Brief)

There are two main types of graphs:

* __Directed Graphs__ are graphs whose edges go a certain way. For example, the edge from node 1 to node 2 may be different in value than the edge from node 2 to node 1.
* __Undirected Graphs__ are graphs whose edges&#39; direction does not matter: `1 -&gt; 2 == 2 -&gt; 1`.

This series (the beginning, at least) will focus on undirected graphs.

There can also be cyclical edges, which are edges that point from one node back to that node.

# Description of Dijkstra&#39;s

__Dijkstra&#39;s Algorithm__ was created in the 1950s by a man named [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra). Its purpose is determining the shortest path between two points, or _nodes_, in a graph of points connected by _edges_.

It has a Time Complexity of `O( num_edges + num_nodes * log(2,num_nodes) )`. You can see that the number of nodes has a more drastic effect than the number of edges.

Let&#39;s say we have some graph:

![graph](//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/fa8a66ccee7152f287d8afe31619f0b2eb339f30.png)
_Taken from [here](http://www.maxburstein.com/blog/introduction-to-graph-theory-finding-shortest-path/), a great Intro to Graph Theory that you should totally go read after finishing this._

We want to find the distance between `A` and `H`. `A` is connected to two nodes, `B` and `C`. Let&#39;s list out the distance from `A` to every other node:

* A: 0
* B: 7
* C: 8
* D: ?
* E: ?
* F: ?
* G: ?
* H: ?

But why did I put all the question marks? It&#39;s because, looking from `A`, we only directly have access to `B` and `C`. All other nodes can only be accessed by going through `B` or `C` (or a node may be totally inaccessible).

But we&#39;re trying to get to H, right? So, if we start from `A`, should we move to `B` or `C`? Well, which one is closer to `A`, meaning which edge-length is smaller? Okay, let&#39;s pick `B`. From `B`, let&#39;s update our data:

* A: 0
* B: 7
* C: 8
* D: ?
* E: ?
* F: 9
* G: ?
* H: ?

Great. From `B` we can only go directly to `F`. Thus, we&#39;ve discovered a distance from `A` to `F`. The distance from `A` to `F` is determined by the sum of the distance from `A` to `B` and `B` to `F`, 9. Now, let&#39;s move to `F` and update our information again:

* A: 0
* B: 7
* C: 8
* D: ?
* E: ?
* F: 9
* G: ?
* H: 12

Oh, would you look at that!? We&#39;re at `H` now! So we know that the distance from `A` to `H` is twelve and our path was `A -&gt; B -&gt; F -&gt; H`.

----
# Conclusion

That&#39;s it for the concept of Dijkstra&#39;s Algorithm. In _Part 1.1_, I&#39;ll walk you through the coding of Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm. We&#39;ll be using matrices (2D arrays). I should also tell you now that I&#39;m going to use C++.  Surprised? I didn&#39;t think so!

I&#39;ll tell you that it personally took me quite a lot of time to get a grasp on Graph Theory and this algorithm. [This article](http://www.maxburstein.com/blog/introduction-to-graph-theory-finding-shortest-path/) was probably the most helpful thing I found on the internet about Dijkstra&#39;s Algorithm. You should totally go read it. I will be using code I wrote myself in the next tutorial, but it is influenced at least slightly by the author of that article.

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a>, there is a routing protocol known as OSPF where “SPF” stands for Shortest Path First. It’s used almost everywhere and the algorithm behind it is Dijkstra’s. Even though its networking implementation is confusing, I highly recommend looking it up so you can understand the high-level image at least. It’s quite interesting.</p>

            <p>Man. Really good stuff <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/oaktree">@oaktree</a>! In this example, could “distance” be exchanged for “speed/ping” for networks? I can picture this being useful for calculating the best route between nodes etc. What are your thoughts?</p>
