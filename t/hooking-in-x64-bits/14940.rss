    <title>Hooking in x64 bits</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/hooking-in-x64-bits/14940</link>
    <description>Hi 0x00sec !!

I’m working on a behaviour detection engine for personal research, in which I should hook windows API function to have such visibility over the monitored process.
I wonder if anyone has already performed hooking in x64 mode?
Using the same technique described in x32 mode presented by dtm, here is the code I tried to inject (0xdeadbeefdeadbeef represent the address of the hooked function)

![patch2|690x232](upload://5mu0WlvZhvH6Wj3QrqHDeVUlRKd.png) 

![patch1|594x220](upload://jIEocFCbj3Z8ElBMIpX1a780eII.png) 

And here is how it&#39;s looks like in the debugger 

![patch0|573x53](upload://pHqrL0ASWSc9wLONFsFRnuLZ9zV.png) 

As you can see, it doesent seem like a jumpable addr .

PS : I don&#39;t want to use other hooking library, I want to implement my own.
Thank you in advance</description>

            <p>Have you tried changing the line with <code>dwNewAddress</code> to use <code>DWORD64</code> instead of <code>BYTE</code>?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">WriteMemory&lt;DWORD64&gt;((LPVOID)(dwFuncAddress + 3), dwNewAddress);
</code></pre>
