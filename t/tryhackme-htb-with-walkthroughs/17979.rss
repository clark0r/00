    <title>TryHackMe - &quot;HTB with walkthroughs&quot;</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/tryhackme-htb-with-walkthroughs/17979</link>
    <description>I came across this in the sponsored section for the [upcoming xmas CTF](https://ctftime.org/event/926).
It&#39;s a breed between HTB and a walkthrough, splitting difficult tasks up into byte sized chunks. If you get stuck at one bit, it usually has a very descriptive task or a good hint that allows you to research into the subject and then continue on. Definitely a more linear path but a great learning experience in my opinion.
I&#39;ve learned a lot from the small amount of time I&#39;ve spent on there so I thought I&#39;d share the link with all of you guys and see what you guys think about it.

Plus, if you get stuck on a challenge and can&#39;t find the solution, you can ask for help in their discord channel and usually you receive it in a very short amount of time, definitely a great community for beginners who want to get into pentesting.</description>

            <p>After a bit more exploring I see they also have normal CTF problems, so it’s not all HTB styled but from what I’ve seen most of it is.</p>
