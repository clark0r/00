    <title>Which network card do you recommend?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/which-network-card-do-you-recommend/20440</link>
    <description>Hi,

I&#39;d like to learn more about wifi attack, how to deauth, create rogue access points and so on.
I&#39;m gonna buy a card to do this and I eared that those from Alfa Network are very good.

Do you guys use these, which model do you prefer ?
Or do you use another brand ?

Also if you have any good stuff to help me learn about wifi attacks that you&#39;d like to share I&#39;d be happy to read it :D

Thanks guys</description>
