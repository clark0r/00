    <title>What are the best ways to spread malware?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/what-are-the-best-ways-to-spread-malware/30831</link>
    <description>I think the title in itself explains my question very well.

What are the most effective/used methods of spreading malware?

Besides the usual standards (phishing emails, fake websites..) what other, perhaps more recent methods are effective and used?

What types of people are most easily targeted?

What form should malware take when spread? (Plain exe, Zip, Rar, Compressed with password) Which is the most profitable?

Thanks.</description>
