    <description>Hello guys, 
I&#39;m looking for an answer to a question. What should I start learning about hacking first? I enjoy hacking, for example. I recently made my own home network and tried to hack it, but I definitely don&#39;t know a lot of things and I&#39;m looking for an answer to the question where to start. If you have any good links where things are well explained, I would be very happy if you would share them. Or some classic character advice is fine, for anything new I will be happy to learn. Thank you in advance.</description>
