### [Realistic challenge 9](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/9/)

#### Message:
&gt;I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re good at hacking, and on the right side of things. So I came looking for you. I really need help, you see, my boss has stopped paying our salaries and I&#39;m going to miss my rent! Please help me get my money, you can reach the site at Crappy Soft. They have an online payment system, but only he can use it. Maybe you can get into his account somehow, but for now you can use mine:

&gt;Username: r-conner@crappysoft.com
Password: ilovemywork

&gt;Thanks man, good luck.



#### What can we extract from the message?

* Find the admin account
* Pay him
* ???


### The site:

The usual stuff.

* Login form
* pictures
* links

### The source


&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/48d4b74eac9f028469a8566c45003b2b638aa350.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;438&quot;&gt;


### The &#39;hack&#39;
[spoiler]

The hack is based on similar attack vector as the last one.
First let&#39;s login with the credentials we were given and snoop around:
&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/5/57d0667fa6ed6a582a1795c1eeb59b15413702ad.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;354&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/1/1da5573718e65d42049d9cfb3d37e5357346a452.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;173&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/3/3b78422a518624bf7fe53b5d892e9c53956c39d1.png&quot; width=&quot;654&quot; height=&quot;208&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/d/d0daf95e009f698022f76018d681d0419e202750.png&quot; width=&quot;689&quot; height=&quot;320&quot;&gt;


So I think we have a pretty good idea what tools we have available and what not.
Our only choice here again is steal a cookie this time somehow through the mailing form.
I personally don&#39;t like this challenge because it involves interaction with a non existent user  and stuff we can&#39;t control.
But here we go...

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/b69086df4fcb6c3f60f9f67b53c064d1112f65a3.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;231&quot;&gt;

basically we send an email to the admin/owner with a custom tailored body in the message section. 
We want him to redirect to a certain site and make him append his browsing cookie. So we can steal it from there...
For this we are going to use [window.location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location).

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/8/87e3abc94e11c048c9cff020d30f29193684f24e.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;309&quot;&gt;

Okay we found the cookie. Let&#39;s change our credentials to the ones we just obtained.
As always this can be done through your browser.

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/4926890d31fbef97cfb1271290b23039b5f8439e.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;302&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/1/111e6cae1123bc439d4433bb2cf065e541aec743.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;47&quot;&gt;


Okay we have access to the payroll now:

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/f/feccf7ae17932ad435714a1a725059233a81814e.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;302&quot;&gt;

Pay him. Okay a sudden new task... Welp.
Let&#39;s check where&#39;s the log located:



&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/d/d1d0a0b4549fdd3b41467c1145b823d5cdf134f1.png&quot; width=&quot;516&quot; height=&quot;159&quot;&gt;

Okay we somehow have to override those through the email newsletter form?
Let&#39;s look at the source and how stuff is handled under the hood..

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/4c38e420e21fbb9433ef872260605273f27b710b.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;427&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/d/d0e50d1d46a000604251d89a9d52f89f602fc3bc.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;262&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/5/5b4f3fbee43f302a25a3b3d74432ea4a51d9db7b.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;188&quot;&gt;




Okay hit subscribe and bam. Challenge done..

# Conclusions
This challenge dealt with similar attack vectors as the last one, but this  challenge wasn&#39;t much fun in my opinion.. Hence I just wanted to finish is quickly and put it out here to continue with the series.

The next article of the series can be found [here](https://0x00sec.org/t/hts-org-r10-challenge/) once it&#39;s up!!
