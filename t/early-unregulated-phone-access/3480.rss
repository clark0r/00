    <title>Early, unregulated phone access</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/early-unregulated-phone-access/3480</link>
    <description>Way back in the day (about 1902, actually) ranches in rural Texas had a rather ingenious way of calling each other on the telephone: They used their barbed wire.

Anyone who has ever played with a POTS (Plain Old Telephone System) phone probably knows that a phone is little more than a 2-wire circuit. What happens when you send current through hundreds of miles of connected barbed wires? Ad-hoc telephone networks!

This is an excellent read, highly recommended.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p><a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/fraq">@fraq</a> has dropped a bunch of concepts here that may be confusing for people not familiar with communications systems. So I will try, with <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/fraq">@fraq</a>’s permission, to expand a bit further. Sure. I like these topics <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>As <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/fraq">@fraq</a> said, that elephant thingy is related to mechanical waves, like sound, not electromagnetic waves. You can always use transducer to convert one type of signal into another tho. Both are waves, but one moves some physical thing (air for sound) and the others “moves” electric and magnetic fields.</p>
<p>Your best option to transmit signals over long distances is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longwave" rel="nofollow noopener">longwaves</a> (see also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low_frequency" rel="nofollow noopener">VLF</a>).  Or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_wave_radio" rel="nofollow noopener">short waves</a> bouncing your signal into the ionosphere… but in that case it will be a kindof point to point link. The best you can do is probably trying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EME_(communications)" rel="nofollow noopener">Moon Bounce</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation" rel="nofollow noopener">FM</a> (and PM) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation" rel="nofollow noopener">AM</a> are analogue modulation techniques. You can decide to use some analogue representation of a digital signal using these modulation, but it is better to use a digital modulation. Their counterparts are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying" rel="nofollow noopener">FSK</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude-shift_keying" rel="nofollow noopener">ASK</a>, being those the simplest digital modulation you could use. But probably you will find more often a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation" rel="nofollow noopener">QAM</a> with some complex symbol constellation. Anyway, at the end, you will get an analogue signal at a certain frequency (that is how nature works <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ).</p>
<p>Finally, the Nyquist theorem is related to sampling, not even to communications. Sampling is the process of converting an analogue signal into a digital signal. For doing that you have to take samples of the continuous analogue signal every certain time (the sample frequency/rate). The Nyquist theorem basically tells you that you need to sample as fast as twice the higher frequency in your analogue signal, to be able to capture all the information it contains.</p>
<p>If you sample at a lower frequency, you may need an antialiasing filter (that will limit the higher frequency in your analogue signal), if you sample faster you are wasting bandwidth.</p>
<p>However, note that sampling is just the first step. You do not get a digital signal after sampling. You actually get a discrete-time signal. To make it digital, you need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)" rel="nofollow noopener">quantize</a> the analogue value you have recorded for each sample. In other words, you have to map each value to a combination of bits. This two process usually happen together tho… your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter" rel="nofollow noopener">ADC</a> circuitry will allow you to specify the sample rate and the number of bits to use (that may be fixed in some cases).</p>
<p>So, for instance your sound card have an ADC. If you record an audio file at 16KHz 16bits, you are sampling at 16KHz (so you are capturing signals up to 8KHz) and quantizing the samples using 16bits.</p>
<p>When you signal is already digital, as it happen with a computer generated value, you do not need to sample it, and the Nyquist theorem does not apply. The value you have is what you have…</p>

            <p>They detect infrasonic vibrations primarily using their feet. Oh, another thing to consider on top of noise is how informationally dense the signal can be and how it would be modulated to encode information. Lower frequencies do not tolerate FM very well, and AM would be hard to detect. Some sort of analog pulse encoding would probably be useful for transmitting digital information, but the bitrate would be painfully slow–slower than a modem most likely.</p>
<p>Here’s some literature on sampling rate and why it’s important</p>

<p>The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem is a theorem in the field of digital signal processing which serves as a fundamental bridge between continuous-time signals and discrete-time signals. It establishes a sufficient condition for a sample rate that permits a discrete sequence of samples to capture all the information from a continuous-time signal of finite bandwidth.
 Strictly speaking, the theorem only applies to a class of mathematical functions having a Fourier transform that is zero outside o...</p>

<p>Elephants do that, ya know.</p>
<p>I think the biggest obstacle to something like that would be the interference from so many other seismic sources. Also, the difference in density of the soil and obstructing objects may make for very messy signals. Not saying it’s impossible, but those are the two biggest obstacles I can see right away.</p>

            <p>Do you know anything about earthing systems? In the UK, there is an earthing system called Tera-Tera for rural properties, you put an earth stake into the ground, and it can use the earth to transfer earth current in the event of a fault.</p>
<p>I have often wondered if we could use this earth transfer as a sort of conductor, for things like phone lines. Could this work? I know the can get a resistance of &lt;200 ohms at 230 volts. What would you need for an earth transfer communications network?</p>
