            <p>All of these replies are great.</p>
<p>The best thing is sending spoofed emails to friends and pranking them, and you are least likely to have charges pressed against you…most times <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I actually recently scared the hell outta a company that was being sexist and racist. I just sent one of the employees a email saying they got hacked. Lulz. Apparently they are now being nice, but that’s reality with the ignorant and hacking. I’m starting to think that sometimes you don’t need to hack. People are just idiots, but hey it sometimes works taking advantage of people’s idiocity. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Still cannot believe this, but I was sitting in starbucks this morning writing up a research paper in latex, with some AUR packages compiling in a terminal… some woman walks past me and takes a look at my screen and then demands that I ‘stop hacking people’s passwords’, then runs off to fetch the manager while i’m attempting to explain the reality of the situation. I then had the manager come over, refuse to listen to me and ask me to leave, as ‘such activity is not tolerated in starbucks, consider this a warning’. I’m gobsmacked. and I’m sure as hell not coming back.</p>

            <p>I looked up porn on a school computer.</p>

<p>Now for a serious reply: the most illegal thing I have ever done was not with a computer but with (you guessed it) electricity/electronics. In the early days when I was exploring the fundamental techniques of radio, I assembled a powerful transmitter without thinking twice. I apparently created a little scrambling in the firefighter/PD radio. Am too afraid to play with radio waves outside of a Faraday’s cache ever since.</p>
<p>This is not a “confession” because it was an accident, but technically it is illegal.</p>
<p>Of course, this accident is not related to 0x00sec. Mods can edit this reply as they please.</p>

            <p>Well… I’ve done a few things that are considered “illegal”. Of course I’m not gonna share. Cheers. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
