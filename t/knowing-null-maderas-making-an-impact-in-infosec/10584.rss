Thanks for stopping by!

### Professional Career and Advice
 
**1. For starters, can you tell us a bit about yourself and your current role/job/work?**

I am a guy who believes that InfoSec/Hacking is my best chance to make the world a better place and leave/make an impact that outlives me.

I’m obsessed with making an impact upon the world; I believe that this art (hacking, by which I also mean Red Teaming/Penetration Testing) presents me with an opportunity to make this world a better place.

I think that to achieve all of the latter, I must endeavor to share all that I learn/experience to help this game evolve.

As the bar rises, those who work toward being the best they can be evolve as well.

I believe that if you are afraid to share everything you know, then you are not working hard enough.

Much of this experience originates from my career. Since January of 2011 I&#39;ve worked as a Penetration Tester/Red Team Operator.

From the beginning, I have focused my skill set on real world, adversarial tactics. This involves a ton of extra study /prep on my part, as I need to track down the work/C2 of BlackHats in the wild study/train until I can emulate their tactics.**

For the last few years (and ever on into the future if I can help it) I’ve endeavored to only work in sectors where I believe I can make an impact that is meaningful to the world at large.

In the past, I&#39;ve worked as the Cybersecurity Penetration Test and Vulnerability Assessment Lab for Schneider Electric and as Senior Red Team Operator/Penetration Tester for National Grid.

Currently, I am between gigs and doing volunteer work for Tutanota (pentesting their next e-mail platform) and running the #CyberpunkisNow project via Twitter, which seeks to create a dialogue between people around the world as to how technology continues to permeate our civilization.

I also release original InfoSec content by my Twitter account, which has grown rapidly and is now reaching millions of screens after only 3 months

**2. How did you first get into the field? (What was your first hack?)**

As long as I can remember, I wanted to be a hacker. I saw a cable news story about The L0pht when I was 12; as a son of Massachusetts, I realized that this was happening in my backyard. I could do this…

As for my first hack, when I was working a customer service gig I used to hack around on the Intranet. The buildings HVAC systems had default creds &amp;amp; the Intranet itself was horribly insecure. I used to bring a live distro of Knoppix STD into work and practice there…nothing really malicious, just exploration.

**3. Can you give a rough map from your beginnings to where you are now?**

As far back as 2006-2007 I was screwing around with Knoppix STD in my former employer’s Intranet (with their permission) after work/on breaks (I was also maintaining AV/AM and that kind of stuff though it wasn&#39;t my or anyone’s job).

By 2009 /2010 I was using Google’s bug bounty program as an excuse to practice vs. their networks/infrastructure; in December 2010/January 2011 I started doing consultant work and officially entered the world of professional InfoSec (where I have been professionally ever since in some form).

**4. What is one of the biggest struggles you overcame? And what’s been the biggest lesson you’ve learned in your career?**

My biggest struggle was also my biggest lesson: learning that in most big businesses, most of your managers/fellow employees arent going to care much about InfoSec. It will almost always take a back seat to profitability.

You have to realize that you yourself are there to help ensure the profitability/prosperity of your employer. Solutions are almost always going to be way more important to them then problems.

**5. Any advice for someone trying to land in a similar role/job?**

Understand the actual basics of Computer Science/Networking/It. You should endeavor to be able to exploit a system/network with the minimal resources possible.

I focused on living of the land from the very beginning of my career/training; it requires that you invest in actually learning things like Windows AD administration &amp;amp; not cutting corners in you training/study, but it is a priceless skill set to have.

Learn defensive skills; spending some time as a Network Analyst is invaluable. Again, the solutions are almost always worth more to the customer/client/employer then the problems.

Make friends with IT &amp;amp; System/Network Administrators if you are working an in-house position. Buy them coffee, talk to them often; there is usually a mutual interest in your and their interests that can result in an incredible skills/knowledge exchange.

You should learn to value all of the skill sets/experience of all the technology employees around you and endeavor to establish relationships based on mutual respect and skills/knowledge exchange.

If one of these employees is a greybeard Unix guru, they will provide insights into Linux/Unix Administration that are priceless (and almost all those I met could/would talk with me for hours, which was incredible).

We all suffer imposter syndrome; not knowing something is ok as long as you endeavor to learn it.

And ICMP/ping doesn’t have a dedicated port; managers running technical interviews love this question.

### Fun, personal stuff

**6. Windows, Mac, or Linux What do you run?**

I run Linux; usually Devuan (Debian without System-D), Qubes or On the job, I am OS agnostic; whatever gets the job done. If possible, I will try to suggest/demonstrate the value of open source, but I am not going to be an obnoxious neckbeard about it.

**7. Programming language(s) of choice?**

Python 2.7, bits and pieces of many other languages. Mainly enough to change/alter code in exploits/tools to get it to do what I need and recognize vulns like deserialization.

**8. Do you use a mechanical keyboard? Is it ortholinear?**

No; I use plain old HP keyboards; I&#39;ve seen some of the mechanical keyboards that have programmable tabs for scripts and stuff and would like to own one some day to build my Master Rig.

**9. Do you have any other hobbies or interests outside of infosec?**

Martial Arts; I’ve had 13 professional fights since 2005 in MMA/Muay Thai/Kickboxing. I&#39;ve competed in kyokushin full contact tournaments as well; I’ve been training in some form of combative since I was 5 (my father was an amateur boxer).

I love reading; I read voraciously. I love film; anime…learning.

I am a huge proponent of self improvement, but not necessarily through self improvement gurus or teachings. I like the classics, like the Tao, Hagakure, The Book Of Rings…and challenging myself.

Challenging myself to know/exceed my limitations probably satisfies my definition of self improvement perfectly.

**10. Any other fun gadgets or hardware at home/the office?**

I&#39;m a huge proponent of the Nexus 7 for Red Teaming/general computing given its power vs cost and ARM architecture; I will have material posted here about ti in 2019.

### Final Stuff

**11. How’d you find 0x00sec?**

The NullByte exodus; I used to number that amongst sources I checked out weekly. I lurked this place forever before joining.

**12. Any other fun fact or detail you’d like to share with the community?**

I admire all of your work; I have infrastructure I&#39;ve built out to keep an eye on things of interest. I don&#39;t know if everyone here knows how rare/beautiful the level of courtesy/talent is here.

**13. Do you have any advice for new, up-and-coming hackers?**

Don&#39;t cut corners; realize tools are just a means of helping to express skills/knowledge that there is no shortcut to ascertain. Your tooling no more makes you a hacker then buying a brush makes you a painter.

**14. Is there anything you’d like to say to the 0x00sec community?**

Thanks for providing a home for me; I went it alone for a long time and realized the upper levels of ability lay in congress with peers. I was right; my skills have grown exponentially in the last 2 years.

**15. Can you give us a HEX for your hat “color”?**

No Hex needed. I&#39;m Gray through and through. I have nothing against BlackHats; we aren&#39;t opponents until a job or circumstance makes us so and then it is only temporary.

I&#39;ve learned more from BlackHats/GrayHats then WhiteHat; most of it was knowledge I had to seek out/cultivate myself, but that is the best kind.

I am an ethical hacker not because it is a convenient term for marketing myself, or because a cert tells me what I am, but because my actions/work are governed by my ethics.
