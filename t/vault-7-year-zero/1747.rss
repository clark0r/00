    <title>Vault 7? Year zero?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/vault-7-year-zero/1747</link>
    <description>I came across an article about WikiLeaks and their new &#39;vault7&#39; campaign to leak CIA hacking tools and information. 

What are your thoughts on this in general (besides &#39;duh&#39;)?</description>

            <p>Lmao, there should be one on the official WikiLeaks page. I followed a link to it on twitter, but I don’t remember what the link is and I certainly didn’t bookmark it. Also, yea that is indeed the full. If I remember correctly, that’'s a profile picture of one of the users.</p>

            <p>Personally, I believe they’ll do both. On the one hand, most criminals absolutely despise the US gvm’t and on the other, some of them want publicity and will go to any measure in order to obtain it which I’m sure (will) include leaking top secret data and documents on the surface web.</p>

            <p>Politically, I hope people finally wake up. Stop the CIA and NSA, they do nothing good for the American people.</p>
<p>Professionally, I’m looking forward to blackhats and whitehats alike using the leaks for new exploits and malware. And I don’t just mean vulnerabilities that remain unpatched on purpose. Far more interesting is how hackers will use “government special tactics” themselves.</p>
<p>Haven’t read that much of it, though, only summaries and some sneak peaks. Maybe I (or some others here at 0x00sec) could take some practical parts of the docs and make write-ups or POCs of what the CIA’s doing.</p>

            <p>I’ll definitely take a look at what seems interesting/scary to me. I need some good stuff to read for next week anyway.<br>
From what I saw aleady there’s a ton of valuable information.</p>
<p>On a side note: I had a good laugh about them explaining how to bypass windows 8 activation lol <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Not sure actually. I’m hoping it could add some insight for me on how I can go about…er…joining them lmao. Looking at their docs, their code, and their files I’m hoping to learn quite a bit from this leak (and I’m sure that there will be other leaks that follow it).</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
There is some really really interesting stuff in there. Honestly, it only makes me want to get in with them even more.</p>

            <p>I think this is pretty cool. I think it could prove to be pretty dangerous territory  though. They have in the past messed with the military, that’s just politics. This time they are going head to head with the CIA.</p>
<p>I think that they might end up getting dropped out or something. All the more power to them though!</p>
