    <title>Need help -- building c code</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/need-help-building-c-code/26335</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, 
so the thing is i need to know how to use [SysWhispers2](https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers2) to convert some api functions i used to Nt* ones,
the problem is how to use it... i mean there may be some nice articles about it / how to generate the output . 
but so far i didnt see anything that help me compile it, [SysWhispers2](https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers2) generates 3 files : 

   * .asm 
   * .h
   * .c

now my program is in c programming language (which is a shellcode injector), i cant use visual studio 2019, because my code wont work as it suppose to, so im kind of stuck with `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc` 

and im not familiar with mingw so how to compile the code all together ? ... 

the api im using: (including others, but these are the one i want to convert to Nt*)
   * WriteProcessMemory
   * CreateRemoteThread
   * VirtualAllocEx

so this command will do it for me:
`python3 syswhispers.py -f NtAllocateVirtualMemory,NtWriteVirtualMemory,NtCreateThreadEx -o syscalls`

lets say i was able to pass my parameters (of the normal api&#39;s)  to NtAllocateVirtualMemory &amp; NtWriteVirtualMemory &amp; NtCreateThreadEx

knowing that of course my code (original one) have `#include &lt;windows.h&gt;` in it.
(im saying that because it showed me that it is an error when including `&quot;syscalls.h&quot;` which also contains  `#include &lt;windows.h&gt;` ... however in the github repo the example shows that he is including the both `#include &lt;Windows.h&gt; &amp;&amp; #include &quot;syscalls.h&quot; in the main program` ... so idk ppl :( )


so how to compile it all together, and what to do with the new `.c` file outputted from syswhispers ? 
knowing that im using linux os .

thanks for your time everyone ...

be sure that i will post another topic about my code !</description>
