            <p>If you want to get an idea of how hacking works and understand the tools that you use then you should check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w" rel="nofollow noopener">LiveOverflow</a> on YouTube, especially his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&amp;list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN" rel="nofollow noopener">Binary Exploitation</a> playlist.</p>
<p>However if you don’t care about it and are just exploring the possibilities of using Kali’s toolset, then you can check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA" rel="nofollow noopener">IppSec</a> on YouTube who uses Kali’s tools to hack into virtual machines (boxes) set up to be hacked.</p>
<p>You can also learn more about Kali itself by reading the <a href="https://www.kali.org/download-kali-linux-revealed-book/" rel="nofollow noopener">Kali Revealed</a> book.</p>
<p>However, while it’s fun to explore hacking and all the things you can do with these amazing tools, you should definitely learn how these things work to get a real grip on hacking and then you can also develop your own tools. If you start hacking people illegally without understanding how their tools work then you turn into a script kiddie. And since script kiddies don’t know how the tools they use work, they don’t know how to get rid of their tracks.</p>
<p>I’m giving you this warning so you don’t go into illegal hacking without first understanding your tools first. And I hope that once you understand them, you get to respect them and never turn to black hat hacking.</p>
