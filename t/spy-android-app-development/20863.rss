    <description>Hi everyone, 

I am currently working on a Spy Android app which will fetch user&#39;s call logs, SMS, Whatsapp messages,  and even i want to record calls (like listen on going call or record calls on server). I am begginner and i dont know much about Android development but still i am creating and trying hard to finish that. I am stuck at a point that how to get access to user&#39;s whatsapp messages and store them on server. Further, i don&#39;t know how to track user&#39;s calls. I want to ask you all please suggest me some sources, functionalities any thing which will help me to fulfill my task. I am searching hard on internet but i not get any relevent information to fulfill my task. For whatsapp, i come to know that if we get mobile&#39;s root access then we can get decryption key of encrypted whatsapp database from user&#39;s phone but i know how to write a code to get android&#39;s root access..Please help.</description>

            <p>I agree that should start with something more simple app.</p>
<p>I can add from my experience.<br>
Back in times, when I wanted to become android dev (now I’m PHP dev) I red a book (sorry, don’t remember name), where you walk through process step by step. In addition read Java: Complete reference (if you are using java not kotlin) and always keep android developer docs keep.<br>
Android developer docs are just awesome.</p>
<p>I suggest to understand all about android. How things work. And only then try to “steal” things.</p>
<p>Clipping together code from stackoverflow or some random github repo’s won’t make a good app.</p>
<p>I hope You understand my point-of-view.<br>
Best regards!</p>

            <p>For a very basic functionality I would encourage you to focus on something simple, like an app that surreptitiously captures the screen and sends that to a server. Once you have that you can take additional functions one step at a time.</p>
