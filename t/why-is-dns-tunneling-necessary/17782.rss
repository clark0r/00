    <title>Why is DNS tunneling necessary</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/why-is-dns-tunneling-necessary/17782</link>
    <description>I understand that it is possible to get around some very tough firewalls by &#39;tunneling&#39; through DNS and send requests to a cooperative authorative DNS server. I don&#39;t exactly understand why this is necessary in a &#39;Command &amp; Control&#39; type application. Assuming such an application was to trust only a hard-coded SSL certificate, not just anything trusted by the machine - i.e. precluding a MITM attack on the part of the firewall, why wouldn&#39;t HTTPS suffice for this communication in evading the suspicion and intervention of a firewall. I admit I am not quite up to date on firewalls, but at a conceptual level I can&#39;t seem why DNS tunneling has any advantage over HTTPS.

Thank you.</description>

            <p>Sooo - the answer is it’s complicated.</p>
<p>The job of a red team (or a real motivated adversary) is to evade detections and telemetry deployed by the blue team.</p>
<p>During recon, the red team may find that the blue team does not have any insight as to DNS requests, and / or is watching HTTP traffic more closely. Whereas a company may have extensive web history logs, they may not be logging DNS.</p>
