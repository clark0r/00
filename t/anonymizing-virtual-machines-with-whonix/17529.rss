    <title>Anonymizing virtual machines with Whonix</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/anonymizing-virtual-machines-with-whonix/17529</link>
    <description># Introduction

* Whonix is security-focused Linux distribution. It uses **enforced** Tor connection. Whonix is distribuited in two virtual machines: &quot;Whonix Gateway&quot; and &quot;Whonix Workstation&quot;.

In this topic, we will use only &quot;Whonix Gateway&quot;.
Whonix can also anonymize other virtual machines by changing ther network adapter to Whonix internal network.

# Setting up Whonix

First thing is to install Whonix Gateway.
**NOTE:** If you use whonix in other purposes, install Whonix Workstation too). 
Here is full instruction on how to download and import it to Virtual Box: [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox/XFCE](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox/XFCE)

After you set up Whonix Gateway, go to Whonix Virtualbox Settings &gt; Network:

* Adapter 1 needs to be set to *NAT*

* Adapter 2 should be Attached to *Internal Network*, name Whonix.

Also, I recommend you, before you start Whonix Gateway, go to Whonix Virtual Box Settings and set  *Base Memory* as low as you can so it won&#39;t reduce performance of other machines.

After setting up Whonix Gateway, open it up and go to Applications and find **Anon Connection Wizzard**. Choose *Connect* and leave everything on default. Leave Whonix Gateway open.

# Setting up network on Virtual Machine

Now, go to settings of your Virtual Machine that you will use and change it&#39;s network settings:

* Adapter 1 attached to *Internal Network*, name Whonix.

Open up your Virtual Machine and go to it&#39;s Network and sharing center (*Windows*) or Wired Connection setting (*Kali Linux*).

## **On Kali Linux:**

Go to **Wired Connection 1 Settings** (Click on gear wheel) and click on **IPv4 tab**. Choose manual and fill settings like this:

### Addresses
**Address** - 10.152.152.3 ; 
**Netmask** - 255.255.192.0 ; 
**Default gateway** -10.152.152.10
### DNS
10.152.152.10

## **On Windows 7:**

Go to *Network and sharing center*, Change adapter settings, Right click on adapter &gt; Properties , IPv4 Properties, click on *Use following IP address*, fill in same as in Kali Linux.

# Conclusion
There you go. Now you have your working Kali LInux with Whonix network.

I hope this was helpful and that it&#39;s valuable. If you have any other opinions on this method and if there is something that I missed or did that could be better, feel free to tell it.</description>
