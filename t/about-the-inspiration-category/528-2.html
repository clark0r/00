            <p>I saw this post the other day on twitter that really inspired me and I wanted to share it with the community. The inevitable truth is…we all get older and sometimes we don’t realize our true passions until later in life. As Chuck mentions, it’s never too late to start something new, to learn something new, to change who we are today so we can live up to our potential tomorrow.</p>
<p>For all the new people wanting to get into or just starting out in cyber security. We don’t have enough cyber security professionals, we need you, don’t give up no matter how overwhelming it may seem or far away it may be until you feel like you are confident in something. You will find your niche and you have something of value to contribute. The biggest value you have right now is your own uniqueness. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=9" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:"></p>
