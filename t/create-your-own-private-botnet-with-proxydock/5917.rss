    <title>Create your own Private Botnet with ProxyDock!</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/create-your-own-private-botnet-with-proxydock/5917</link>
    <description>Hello, fellow 0x00&#39;ers!

First off, I lied. It&#39;s not a botnet. But it enables you to achieve botnet-like abilities. 

Today I am going to show you something that has been kept a secret for a long time in the hacker community and has never really been made accessible to the average hobbyist. With this knowledge you will be able to:

* Bypass rate limits on API&#39;s
* Google dork with impunity
* Scan hosts extremely stealthily
* Leverage hundreds of IP addresses, legally, and quickly

And if that doesn&#39;t already sound incredible. You&#39;ll be able to do it all for less than 2.99 euro a month.

# Why

If you&#39;ve ever tried to automate any sort of scraping, Google dorking, or pulling from API&#39;s with rate limits, you&#39;ll know this little guy very well,

![](upload://ooSpFuihfekq3K6kSxG2049Q3CH.png)

The dreaded captcha.

A traditional way you would bypass this would be to scrape some public proxies, however, Google has gotten smarter and upped their detection game. Using any public proxy, or any known Tor exit node doesn&#39;t work either. Providers are quick to block these (freenode, API providers, and others).

Now the only option left seems to be VPN&#39;s. Many VPN&#39;s are difficult to detect, and very rarely ever used to scrape as switching between them is really difficult. Today that is about to change.

# Theory
My first idea to solve this problem was to get a bunch of different computers and virtual machines, hook them up to a VPN, stand up a HTTP proxy server on them, and then manually load them up in a proxychains file. Sounds like a good idea, except it would take forever for my entire 45 VPN files. 

Instead of using actual computers, I decided this would be a good job for Docker.

Inside each ProxyDock docker container, is OpenVPN connected to a VPN tunnel, with a HTTP proxy server exposed on port 8080, all traffic sent through port 8080 will go through the VPN connection. 

The simple bash script repeats this for however many VPN files you have in the VPN directory. For each VPN file, it will forward the port 8080 on the container, to a local port, and it will write the local connection port into a proxychains configuration, which means usage of these proxies is super simple.

# Using ProxyDock
## Downloading
If you haven&#39;t already, [download this](https://github.com/pry0cc/ProxyDock/)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pry0cc/ProxyDock/
```

Now, create a new directory called &#39;VPN&#39;
```
cd ProxyDock
mkdir VPN
```
Put all your OpenVPN`.ovpn` files in there, and make sure they do not have any sketchy characters, they should look like this:

https://0x0.st/sBiA.png


## Remove auth prompts from connection files 
#### (skip this if it doesn&#39;t prompt you on connection)
Now, with most providers, they have built-in authentication prompts, so when you run `openvpn file.ovpn`, it will load, and ask for a username and password, not very helpful for automation, you can easily solve this using an `auth.txt` file.

Create a file in the ProxyDock directory called `auth.txt`, inside that file put your username, followed by your password on a newline. Then, append `auth-user-pass auth.txt` to each file in the VPN directory, a simple bash one liner will do the trick nicely:

```bash
for f in $(cd VPN; bash -c ls); do echo &quot;auth-user-pass auth.txt&quot; &gt;&gt; VPN/$f; done
```

You may find that if the string is not on a new line by itself, then this won&#39;t work, it&#39;s a bit hacky, but re-running this oneliner usually fixes that.

You can test this worked by running `sudo openvpn VPN/vpnfile.ovpn`, and it should connect without any prompts.

## Building the Dockerfile
I have included a script for this, so it&#39;s easy as:
```bash
./build.sh
```

## Running ProxyDock!
Now you have done all the setup, it is time to run the `start.sh` script and let the beautiful collection of proxies startup before your eyes.

A simple run of `docker ps`, should reveal the running containers.

# Demo&#39;s
 
Starting:

Usage:
[![asciicast](upload://43RFuPuf9SbpmrwxzZQI54UrPUd.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/gfNulkjQayioP7D26XvNy8eJ9)

# Usage
Simply use proxychains in the current directory, proxychains will automatically recognize that a proxychains.conf is present and will use it. 

Non-icmp nmap scans, curl&#39;s, and other fun stuff can be run through proxychains, and each request will use a different proxy, you can even couple this to an IRC client or browser for maximum hacker cred :laughing:

# Conclusions
This method is extremely simple, very affordable, and a wonder that nobody has thought of this before. What is very cool about this, is that you can throw in as many VPN files to the VPN directory, and potentially have the reach of 400-500 different non-blacklisted IP addresses. You essentially have a botnet that you can use for scraping or whatever else you&#39;re doing.

            <p><code>curl</code> is already installed in my Ubuntu host. I thought that this would make <code>curl</code> accessible to each container, but running <code>which curl</code> from within any docker container returns nothing. When I try to  run <code>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install curl -y</code> from within a docker container (e.g. from brave_davinci, shown above), the instruction times out because the container cannot resolve the named apt repositories. Does DNS need to be configured separately, or is this indicative of a misconfigured VPN as you had originally suggested?</p>

            <p>Thanks for getting back to me <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a>. I double-checked my VPN configuration using the steps from this article - I had forgotten to remove the “sketchy” characters from my .ovpn file names. I verified that the VPN files were configured properly by running <code>sudo openvpn VPN/vpnfile.ovpn</code>.</p>
<p>I took the additional steps of completely removing and reinstalling Docker, and I re-ran the build.sh and start.sh scripts.</p>
<p>I think that I captured the other troubleshooting steps that were suggested in your reply. Please see the attached screenshot. I am trying to use 7 .ovpn files provided from FrootVPN, so the number of available docker containers shown in <code>docker ps</code> appears to be correct. It looks like <code>curl</code> actually might not be accessible to any of my containers (not sure how to install it either). I would consider myself a docker newbie so please bear with me. Thanks again for your support.</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/srrpub">@srrpub</a>, can you verify the tunnel is open? Run <code>docker ps</code> and see the port maps manually.</p>
<p>Can you also verify that you can connect to the VPN’s from within the docker container? Find a docker container that is running, find it’s name, and run</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">docker exec -ti "container_name" bash
</code></pre>
<p>Once in, attempt to <code>curl  google.com</code>, if this succeeds, then you can be confident it’s not a VPN issue, but rather a proxy issue. If however it does not succeed, and you cannot connect out, then it’s a problem your VPN configuration. Verify that it connects properly to the VPN, and that your <code>auth-user-pass auth.txt</code> file is correctly setup.</p>

            <p>Thanks for writing this article and sharing this technique. I tried to recreate the simple demonstration that was provided above, wherein curl is called, but I am getting timeout errors and I am not quite sure why. I followed each of the steps that were listed, and I even signed up for FrootVPN just to maintain as much of the setup  as possible. I would appreciate any suggestions on how to fix this issue, and would be happy to follow up with additional info. I have pasted my errors below.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">|R-chain|-&lt;&gt;-127.0.0.1:5006-&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;-4.2.2.2:53-&lt;--timeout
|DNS-response|: google.com does not exist
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: google.com

It looks like the proxies do not have access to DNS so I tried to manually specify an IP address within one of Google's IP ranges (64.233.160.100, to be exact). In a web browser, this resolved just fine, but I got the following error message when trying to run curl.

user@ubuntu:~/ProxyDock$ sudo proxychains curl 64.233.160.100
ProxyChains-3.1
|R-chain|-&lt;&gt;-127.0.0.1:5037-&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;-64.233.160.100:80-&lt;--timeout
curl: (7) Couldn't connect to server

            <p>Hello, fellow 0x00’ers!</p>
<p>First off, I lied. It’s not a botnet. But it enables you to achieve botnet-like abilities.</p>
<p>Today I am going to show you something that has been kept a secret for a long time in the hacker community and has never really been made accessible to the average hobbyist. With this knowledge you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bypass rate limits on API’s</li>
<li>Google dork with impunity</li>
<li>Scan hosts extremely stealthily</li>
<li>Leverage hundreds of IP addresses, legally, and quickly</li>
</ul>
<p>And if that doesn’t already sound incredible. You’ll be able to do it all for less than 2.99 euro a month.</p>

<h1>Why</h1>
<p>If you’ve ever tried to automate any sort of scraping, Google dorking, or pulling from API’s with rate limits, you’ll know this little guy very well,</p>
<p><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/a/ab04177e186582ebdef4ebe628e65ccc31e477db.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="ooSpFuihfekq3K6kSxG2049Q3CH" width="424" height="274"></p>
<p>The dreaded captcha.</p>
<p>A traditional way you would bypass this would be to scrape some public proxies, however, Google has gotten smarter and upped their detection game. Using any public proxy, or any known Tor exit node doesn’t work either. Providers are quick to block these (freenode, API providers, and others).</p>
<p>Now the only option left seems to be VPN’s. Many VPN’s are difficult to detect, and very rarely ever used to scrape as switching between them is really difficult. Today that is about to change.</p>
<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>My first idea to solve this problem was to get a bunch of different computers and virtual machines, hook them up to a VPN, stand up a HTTP proxy server on them, and then manually load them up in a proxychains file. Sounds like a good idea, except it would take forever for my entire 45 VPN files.</p>
<p>Instead of using actual computers, I decided this would be a good job for Docker.</p>
<p>Inside each ProxyDock docker container, is OpenVPN connected to a VPN tunnel, with a HTTP proxy server exposed on port 8080, all traffic sent through port 8080 will go through the VPN connection.</p>
<p>The simple bash script repeats this for however many VPN files you have in the VPN directory. For each VPN file, it will forward the port 8080 on the container, to a local port, and it will write the local connection port into a proxychains configuration, which means usage of these proxies is super simple.</p>
<h1>Using ProxyDock</h1>
<h2>Downloading</h2>
<p>If you haven’t already, <a href="https://github.com/pry0cc/ProxyDock/">download this</a></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">git clone https://github.com/pry0cc/ProxyDock/
</code></pre>
<p>Now, create a new directory called ‘VPN’</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">cd ProxyDock
mkdir VPN
</code></pre>
<p>Put all your OpenVPN<code>.ovpn</code> files in there, and make sure they do not have any sketchy characters, they should look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://0x0.st/sBiA.png" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://0x0.st/sBiA.png</a></p>
<h2>Remove auth prompts from connection files</h2>
<h4>(skip this if it doesn’t prompt you on connection)</h4>
<p>Now, with most providers, they have built-in authentication prompts, so when you run <code>openvpn file.ovpn</code>, it will load, and ask for a username and password, not very helpful for automation, you can easily solve this using an <code>auth.txt</code> file.</p>
<p>Create a file in the ProxyDock directory called <code>auth.txt</code>, inside that file put your username, followed by your password on a newline. Then, append <code>auth-user-pass auth.txt</code> to each file in the VPN directory, a simple bash one liner will do the trick nicely:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">for f in $(cd VPN; bash -c ls); do echo "auth-user-pass auth.txt" &gt;&gt; VPN/$f; done
</code></pre>
<p>You may find that if the string is not on a new line by itself, then this won’t work, it’s a bit hacky, but re-running this oneliner usually fixes that.</p>
<p>You can test this worked by running <code>sudo openvpn VPN/vpnfile.ovpn</code>, and it should connect without any prompts.</p>
<h2>Building the Dockerfile</h2>
<p>I have included a script for this, so it’s easy as:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">./build.sh
</code></pre>
<h2>Running ProxyDock!</h2>
<p>Now you have done all the setup, it is time to run the <code>start.sh</code> script and let the beautiful collection of proxies startup before your eyes.</p>
<p>A simple run of <code>docker ps</code>, should reveal the running containers.</p>
<h1>Demo’s</h1>
<p>Starting:<br>
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/mNUIk7oxrF6JAHhFANAPvgofl"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/4cf8f9c8e646b60c2200aefb7a7f42800408530b.png" alt="asciicast" data-base62-sha1="aYVInrTfdRrEgSJ2LerPOE1eKnx" width="690" height="407"></a></p>
<p>Usage:<br>
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/gfNulkjQayioP7D26XvNy8eJ9"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/1/1c788f8af1622a8ba9b4f26106166518d81827d1.png" alt="asciicast" data-base62-sha1="43RFuPuf9SbpmrwxzZQI54UrPUd" width="690" height="407"></a></p>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>Simply use proxychains in the current directory, proxychains will automatically recognize that a proxychains.conf is present and will use it.</p>
<p>Non-icmp nmap scans, curl’s, and other fun stuff can be run through proxychains, and each request will use a different proxy, you can even couple this to an IRC client or browser for maximum hacker cred <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/laughing.png?v=9" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"></p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>This method is extremely simple, very affordable, and a wonder that nobody has thought of this before. What is very cool about this, is that you can throw in as many VPN files to the VPN directory, and potentially have the reach of 400-500 different non-blacklisted IP addresses. You essentially have a botnet that you can use for scraping or whatever else you’re doing.</p>
