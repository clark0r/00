    <title>The Illusion of Control: Intellectual Discussion</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/the-illusion-of-control-intellectual-discussion/817</link>
    <description>Today I wanted to share something with you that has been on my mind, it doesn&#39;t really collide with hacking or infosec in general, but still it is fairly relevant. And yes, this topic has definitely been pulled from Mr. Robot as Elliott has talked about all the time, and it&#39;s been on my mind lately, so why not discuss it with you guys too.

**

**THE ILLUSION OF CONTROL**

**




So the dilemma here really is the fact that we as humans believe and perceive that we have control of our lives, careers, relationships friendships and so on. And that when we fail in our endeavors, it&#39;s a part of the process, in which it makes us feel at ease knowing that we can recover from that occurrence, and we&#39;ll be fine. Which is where i&#39;d say the illusion of having control comes in, because what if we exactly didn&#39;t have control in the first place, and could of continued with our &#39;path&#39;, and yet failed, hence the illusion of control.

Then, I would also counter-argue that perspective, saying that the illusion of us having control is the definition of human imperfection, that we&#39;re never supposed to have control, and that&#39;s what makes us unique, and the entire process of achieving our goal worth the fight.

_____
**Elliott&#39;s view:**


Elliott&#39;s view is that, we are **being** controlled by this 1% that he talked about in Season 1. But, what if that&#39;s false, and they only have an impact on the flow of economy, and the media/advertisements have an impact on our perception. And we can decide the rest, so to say.

I hope you have some interesting responses.</description>

            <p>In my oppinion we are controlled. Every decision we make is programmed before we do it by the chemical and physical rules.<br>
<em>Do I want to say: “don’t make decisions”?</em><br>
<em>No.</em> I only want to say we are controlled and we can’t do something again our decisions. But if you think you mustn’t make decision you are wrong. It’s also controlled if you think you mustn’t make decisions.</p>
<p>I hope I haven’t writen decision wrong</p>

            <p><span class="mention">@unh0lys0da</span>,<br>
You are right. It is the corrupted people in power.</p>
<p>You also mentioned that greed is a factor. I agree. However, they are wickedly stupid as they are greedy for money. In the end, they’ll realize that you can’t eat money.</p>
<p>All they learn is to chase cash and they seem awfully… Not-so-bright. So, they’ll suffer once they realize everything else is gone and all they have is money. Money has no value but what humans place on it. What happens when none of us take their blood-money?</p>

            <p>This might actually be the problem. I’ve been playing for a while with the thought that Aristocracy might be better than democracy, but I think this is the option noone ever mentions. Good leaders are the ones that don’t get consumed by greed / power. Sadly in todays society only the greedy get in power, the ones already corrupt become the next leader.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>There is control in many ways.</p>
<p>I was raised with Native American culture… So let me explain from my angle. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>
<p>We can control ourselves. The rest is an illusion.</p>
<p>When children are growing up, there is always a natural leader. The elders observe and discover that natural leader. Then the elders guide him or her to be a chief or type of leader (yes women were leaders and were valued more than white people valued women). They are taught to guide people to be kind to all things and all people…</p>
<p>The Europeans came, tried to slaughter them and were proof what happens when you do not guide a natural leader. We also saw there was a power struggle. That is where the saying “too many chiefs and not enough Indians” came from. One day f the Chiefs was attempting to guide these stinky, toothless beasts into understanding by saying “white man has too many chiefs”. Meaning too many people ordering people around and they SUCKED at it. Which is why another chief stated that before white men, no one was homeless, no one was hungry, there were no taxes…</p>
<p>The 7th generation (you) will be the people to change it. Observation helped them figure out natural leaders. Observation showed white men were totally evil (the Columbus followers… Not all white people). Observation showed them a prediction (stated as a vision or dream) by a chief. He said the 7th generation would rise with the Europeans and bring back the original ways.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I’m saying…<br>
We are in control of our actions, but not others. It is an illusion that morons are leading us. It is YOU who will bring back peace. The predictions of the Chiefs have been correct this far… I have no doubt this observation was true as well.</p>
<p>If you choose to do nothing… Then it will not happen. It is still YOUR will and a power struggle with Columbians and the 7th generation.</p>
<p>Did this make sense?</p>
<p>Also note: That USA stole Hitler’s team to learn mind control. So there is another illusion as you are GUIDED (not predestined) to choose certain lifestyles.</p>

            <p>Because Buddhism is not a religion but rather a discipline. It is very interesting and the stories past down are much like stories Tribes (Apache, Cherokee, Lakota…) past down to us. It helps us better understand the discipline. Religion (at least the Christian religion) was started for greed. (I’m not talking spirituality here, but organized religion).</p>

            <p>You mean mixing Buddhism with  a normal lifestyle? Just start meditating. Even 5 mins a day, just sit somewhere where you won’t get disturbed, close your eyes, and let what happens happen. I’ve watched quite a few “tutorials” on meditation on youtube, and talked to people who’ve done it for years, and I reckon that’s the best way to start. Though I think any big benefits are long term.</p>

            <p>My 2.5 cents…</p>
<p>Control doesn’t exist, only limitations and chances imposed on the future - which create an illusion of control.</p>
<p>Different systems* impose various limitations, but in the end, they don’t control. They steer.<br>
Chances are binary - either it will be, or it won’t. So everything has a 50/50 chance.<br>
Future - the only time which matters. Past cannot be unwritten, and the now is already the past.</p>
<p>In the end, the only thing which matters is what you do. Upon your actions you will judge yourself. Everything else is relative.</p>
<p>'* - everything is a system. Consider it a fractal in chaos-speak.</p>

            <p>“I think therefore I am”, is the only thing we know for certain.<br>
There is no ‘proof’ for the brain being the only cause of awareness.<br>
There never can be proof, because the only way to find out is in death.<br>
Science does have the principle of probability, but strictly speaking neither your or my theory can be proven in a scientific experiment.</p>

<p>human behaviour and thoughts, emotions</p>

</aside>
<p>Both of these are intangible concepts but they are both tied to the physical realm. Emotions are all controlled through consequences of hormones within the brain. Thoughts and the “mind” are the intangible however neither can exist without the brain and vice versa (<strong>cough</strong> Matrix <strong>cough</strong>). Think of these two like time and space. Space is the physical and time is the conceptual. Neither can exist without the other, hence why people call it <em>space time</em>. Or, an even better example, like the hardware and the software of computers.</p>

            <p>Yeah, that is true, however I dont see how a mathematical rhythm can collide with human behaviour and thoughts, emotions and so on. If the Universe foillows a rhythm, then there’s an algortihm. And algortithms are designed to do just one job, and that doesnt include emotions, because that is beyond it’s control.</p>
<p>An example would be algortihms that are  deployed in the financial world. A lot of them have been in use, and they are controlling the flow of money, hence the reason why its so hard to win in the lottery because of an algortihm. it’s designed to do just one job.</p>

<p>I think it is. If you look at it from the point of view of the Theory of Chaos. At the end the world is dynamic and non-linear despite of our efforts to linearise everything. We do that because we do not know yet how to deal with reality <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Look at the logistic map ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map</a>), such a simple equation produces very complex behaviours. The universe is driven by a bunch of simple rules… but we do not know them… yet <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>We’re always controlled. By ourselves. Debt. Everything. As humans- we have multiple illusions. Of anonymity, of love, of control as you were saying, and perhaps of life. Those are always the scariest. Why? They base our decisions. They lead us to make certain decisions. Those decisions many times lead into other aspects of control. For example, you receive a card saying you’ve won a prize. Most people would reject it, but some would somehow be under the idea of the illusion of luck. And I’m not saying luck isn’t or is real. But they think that they one out of luck. Which is an illusion. Little do they know that they’ve been scammed out of all their life savings onnce having followed everything on the card to get “their prize”. That leads to even more control- debt.</p>

            <p>Well think about our weird universal constants (<code>e</code>, <code>pi</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>G</code>,<code>c</code>, etc.). It’s possible that our universe follows a <em>mathematical rhythm</em>.</p>

            <p>It was more meant to show, that we <em>think</em> we decide free, but that our brain already chose an option before. This is a good example of what I think the free will depends on: It depends just on events happened before. An example for better illustration:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>11th September -&gt; Better security in airports -&gt; Security check takes longer -&gt; You miss your flight -&gt; You come too late to your job interview -&gt; You don’t get the new job -&gt; Meet your big love in your old job -&gt; etc…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Of course this example sounds weird, but I think it underlines the determinism, in which I believe <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">.</p>

            <p>The study does not show that decisions are predestined, it means that our <em>subconscious</em> mind has already processed the information before our <em>conscious</em> mind has realized that decision. As for “destiny”, it’s a pretty debatable topic. Given a specific set of factors, things will always happen in the <strong>exact</strong> same manner, “same experiment, same result”, if you will. Do our minds work the same way?</p>
<p>Also, does this mean that since the beginning of the universe and every single factor “set” at that point would have contributed to every single possible state of the (our) universe? Every birth and death of a star and every single scenario which has lead our solar system and Earth to form and every single decision made by every single organism which has lead up until the present day. Who knows? Perhaps if scientists discover multiverses, it might shed <em>some</em> light.</p>
<p>But back on topic, yes, there have been some controversial discussions about this “illusion of freedom”. There are some examples which are, I guess more prominent, such as advertisement and consumerism where people are subconsciously(?) and psychologically(?) manipulated.</p>

            <p>yeah in that  correlation possibly. But I mean more in terms of 10 years ahead of your life, 4 years that kind of stuff. Small things as you just mentioned with the study, where the brain makes a decision 5 seconds before we know it, that seems like a possibility, but anything beyond that doesnt.</p>

            <p>If I remember correctly, I heard of a study about that topic. Some scientists asked people to choose between two options. When they chose between them, they laid in an MRT (magnetic resonance tomography), which measured their brain activity. In the recordings of the MRT, the scientists could see, that everytime the people made a decision the brain already had made a decision 5 (!) seconds before the people knew it; so decisions are predestined. I think you don’t decide free.</p>
<p>I have the same oppinion as <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/oaktree">@oaktree</a> and had it already before I heard of this study.</p>

            <p>It’s not planned out, but it was going to happen. Thing about it retrospectively. What happened was going to happen – whether you expected it or not.</p>

            <p>so you believe everything is planned out? every single thought you conduct, every decision every time you miss the bus, every time you’re late for work class, every time you’re in a fight sorrow. when you buy new clothes foods?</p>
<p>to me that seems naive and unrealistic.</p>
<p>but we all have our own opinions.,</p>
