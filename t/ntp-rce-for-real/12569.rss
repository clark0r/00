    <title>NTP RCE - for real?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/ntp-rce-for-real/12569</link>
    <description>Hi folks,

I did a lot of research the past days about vulnerabilities in NTP and came across several scripts for DoS attacks.

However, I&#39;ve read as well one some pages that &quot;there are NTP RCE attacks&quot; in the wild. 

Has anyone knowledge about this? As said, I read all I could find but didn&#39;t find any more information than &quot;that it is out there&quot;. Nothing specific.

I&#39;d appreciate if anyone knows some resources to study.

Thanks and you all have a great week</description>

            <p>Have you tried the CVE page? Might not have any recent vulnerabilities that could be being used for attacks.</p>
