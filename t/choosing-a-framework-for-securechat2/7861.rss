    <title>Choosing a framework for SecureChat2</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/choosing-a-framework-for-securechat2/7861</link>
    <description>I&#39;m working on the next installment of SecureChat ([SecureChat2](https://github.com/spec-sec/SecureChat2)), and I&#39;m strongly considering moving development over to Node JS. I need a database ORM and Rest API to keep track of messages, chat sessions, keys, and to authenticate users. I&#39;ve been looking at [LoopBack](https://loopback.io), but I&#39;m afraid of starting a new project on LoopBack 3 when LoopBack 4 is already in development (and v3 uses packages that have vulnerabilities). LoopBack 4, however, is not production ready and lacks widespread support. If anyone has a recommendation for a good framework to use, I&#39;d really appreciate it!</description>
