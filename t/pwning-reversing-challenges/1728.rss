    <title>Pwning/Reversing Challenges</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/pwning-reversing-challenges/1728</link>
    <description>Since I&#39;ve noticed quite a lot of interest in low-level stuff from the community recently, especially on IRC when it comes to reversing/exploit dev, below you&#39;ll find some pwning/reversing challenges that I&#39;ve enjoyed playing over the past months.

**_Note:_** _I won&#39;t be referring to the ones everyone is talking about ( i.e overthewire, smashthestack etc ) since they are kinda getting &quot;old&quot; in my opinion._

So:

[HackCenter](https://hackcenter.com/compete/xxdme) - These challenges are hosted by CMU (Carnegie Mellon University). I highly recommend those. Here&#39;s one of the many [reasons](https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/05/carnegie-mellons-mayhem-ai-takes-home-2-million-from-darpas-cyber-grand-challenge/).

[LSE CTF](https://ctf.lse.epita.fr/) - @IoTh1nkN0t and I have been playing around with the &#39;crackmes&#39; category of that website. They are quite decent and the difficulty level increases quite fast. They&#39;ve got pwning/shellcode/web/crypto/forensics as well.

[microcorruption](https://microcorruption.com/) - Really fun reversing challenges with an exceptional GUI. It gets you in the process of researching since the &quot;binaries&quot; are using a different ISA from the one you&#39;re probably used to.

[pwnable.tw](https://pwnable.tw/) / [pwnable.kr](http://pwnable.kr/) - I think the title says it all.

[picoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) - Not sure if @0x00pf has anything to do with it ;). Either way, these challenges are at the level of high school CTFs and they are highly recommended for CTF beginners. I believe they are hosted by [PPP](http://pwning.net/). If you don&#39;t know PPP, you should definitely google them. 

[RPISEC](https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE) - This is an open course on Modern Binary Exploitation with lectures slides and quite a lot of reversing/pwning challenges.

[protostar](https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/) - From basic to slightly intermediate exploit dev challenges with source code provided for each level. If you are stuck with any of the challenges, you should 100% check out LiveOverflow on youtube.

Oh well, I think these are more than enough for now. If you&#39;ve got more suggestions, feel free to let us know in the comment section.

Hack fun,

            <p>I liked microcorruption because it felt like a fun game and not that much as a pure task to complete. If it’s not your style then check out protostar and use LiveOverflow’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w" rel="nofollow noopener">channel</a> as a reference ( the binary hacking series ). He’ll get you up to speed quite fast.</p>

            <p>I started micro corruption but it made me feel pretty uncomfortable because of the GUI. I want to learn in a quite practical setup, so that my skills can be transferred to other things.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a>: Protostar and microcorruption. Start with microcorruption though because the GUI will get you hooked imo.</p>
