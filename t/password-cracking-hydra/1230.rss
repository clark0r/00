    <title>Password Cracking: Hydra</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/password-cracking-hydra/1230</link>
    <description>This is a tutorial that has been bugging me for a while and I&#39;ve decided to post this tutorial, just to see how well it goes. This isn&#39;t a series, but a one shot. If there&#39;s enough interest I will maybe start a mini series. 

# Passwords

Passwords are arguably the most common method for authentication (probably is). Of course we could just go ahead and exploit the system itself, but in my experience it&#39;s easier to hack a specific account, which is protected by a password, that&#39;s on server then compromising a whole entire system itself. There are many different methods to crack passwords,but the ones discussed here are : Dictionary, Bruteforce, and People (Social Engineering, Phishing, People&#39;s stupidity, all of the above). 

All, but the latter can be attempted with a software called THC-Hydra (Hydra). 

# Hydra

Hydra is a password cracking tool that&#39;s only on Linux (Sorry Window users). The tool itself is pre-installed on Kali Linux and Parrot, but if for some reason it&#39;s not installed simply type:

```
apt-get install hydra
```

Once hydra is installed type:

```
hydra
```

Upon enter the help page should show up. For now we&#39;re only interested in the **-l** flag and the **-P** flag. 

The syntax for hydra is a follows:

```
hydra (options) host (service)
```

A simple example is:

```
hydra -l root -P wordlist.txt 127.0.0.1 smtp
```
The flag **-l** is for the username. The **-P** flag can be either **-p**, for a single password or **-P**, for a file containing words to try. You have to specify the whole path for the **-P** flag. After the options is the host&#39;s Ip and the service. The service is optional to specify, but can be useful during a cracking procedure. A more realistic example is:

```
hydra -l root -P /root/Desktop/wordlist.txt 127.0.0.1 
```
What if we&#39;re trying to crack a email account password? This is where things get more interesting. Every email service has a service known as a smtp service. The smtp service is where the email process actually is. A simple example is the **smtp.gmail.com** server. The port that the smtp service is actually running on varies from smtp service to another, but for smtp.gmail.com the smtp service runs on port 565. The interesting part is that Hydra has flags that can specify a port and also the service. A example is:

```
hydra -l jdoe@gmail.com -P /root/Desktop/wordlist.txt -S 565 smtp.gmail.com smtp
```

The last flag of Hydra that I will introduce in this tutorial is the **-x** flag. Sometimes the user has a ridiculously long and complicated password that dictionaries attacks have no effect, but there&#39;s one method that all passwords are vulnerable to, bruteforce attacks. In a bruteforce attack every combination is used to figure out the password. The speed depends on the cpu processor, but in the end the password will be cracked. In hydra the bruteforce option is invoked like this:

```
hydra -l John Doe -x Shortest length: longest length: combinations host
```

A example for gmail would look something like this:

```
hydra -l jdoe@gmail.com -x 5:8:A1 -S 565 smtp.gmail.com smtp
```

These are only some of the capabilities of Hydra.</description>

            <p>i’d just like to interject for a moment. you should have just read what description of hacking you pasted there, you’re contradicting yourself, says it’s all about learning and enjoying together. hacking isnt necessarily related to computers, it can be anything. hackers are problem solvers. you can only do that when you know about what you’re dealing with, in depth.<br>
also, necrobumping old threads with offtopic questions/comments isn’t a good idea. you’ve been doing it for a while. if you feel like asking something, open a new thread instead of starting offtopic discussions on old threads. if you want to appreciate someone, give them a <code>like</code>, they do see it in their notifications. as blackwidow already said, most of the chat, and offtopic stuff goes in the IRC, that’s what it is for. quality of content is one of those things that sets this community apart from others.<br>
as far as your question about hacking that account is concerned, i’d advise you to drop this attitude and focus more on learning and understanding. my personal opinion is that people should also understand that they need to be responsible for their actions with the power they possess. you cannot go on creating chaos around and hacking people for personal grudge. that’s just being really silly.  ofcourse you can use your powers to aid your nefarious intentions, but i’ll never encourage that. pretty sure you’ll enjoy this place and the people here once you understand what we’re collectively trying to convey.<br>
anyway, if you’re still feeling we’re all ganging up on you, and that you’re here to prove that you’re on the right side of things, no one can help you.</p>

            <p>Thanks Mr. <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/vvid0w">@VVid0w</a> and Sorry all of you for  my question but i though you could help me with some basic steps not the all way to hack… If its not a hacking forum why tag the Word “HACKING” on the must discussion topics of this forum??? and Why Sharing things like How to Spoof Facebook Account???"<br>
<strong>&gt; The hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of software systems to achieve novel and clever outcomes. The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed “hacking”. (<a href="http://wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow noopener">wikipedia.org</a>)</strong> Isnt it What we all are doing here enjoying All those things about Systems limitations??? If Not Sorry and you all are right i’m in a wrong Forum.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>10enrasca</p>

            <p>With the invite-only enabled we didn’t look into people or what they were like, we just accepted every request.</p>
<p>It just made the whole registration system way more awkward and noisy. It did its job for when it was needed. Making the registration system open is not a bad move.</p>

            <p>Well first and foremost, we’re not your personal army &amp; we’re not a blackhat site. With that out of the way, let’s get down to business.</p>
<hr>
<p>First, you’re gonna need to learn Linux. Or at least enough to <em>not</em> be a beginner.</p>
<p>Second, what social network are you trying to hack? I’m going to go ahead and assume facebook here, but the kind of attacks you use depend on which social network the account is that you want to hack.</p>
<p>Third, You don’t need the host’s IP and Service to hack their account. You need their personal information and /or password. You’ll also need their email account. How you go about getting that is up to you.</p>
<p>Now technically, you <em>could</em> pwn their box and dump passwords from their browser cache. Chances are, they’re going to have the same password for all of their accounts. How you do that is up to you.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m going to assume that you’re not trying to hack someone that you have no permission to, and instead you’re doing this as an exercise with a friend. Again…</p>
<p><em>We are not your personal army and we are not a blackhat site. This site is for learning and using what you learn legally and for good purposes.</em></p>
<p>I’m not sure if I’m stepping over a line here, but PLEASE STOP asking questions like this. If you want to ask these kinds of questions then you can either go on the <a href="https://blog.0x00sec.org/irc/">IRC</a> or head over to <a href="https://hackforums.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Hack Forums</a>. Thanks.</p>

            <p>A way to bypass this restriction exists when the target only locks out your IP: get a list of proxies and change proxy every * amount of attempts.</p>
<p>The story is different if the target locks out the account</p>

            <p>There really isn’t protection against bruteforcing except, have a strong password, limit the number of tries, etc. I personally stick to the wordlist method or the People method, but bruteforcing can still work if given enough time and patience.</p>
