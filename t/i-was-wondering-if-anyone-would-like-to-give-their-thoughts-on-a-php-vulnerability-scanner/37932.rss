    <description>Heyo everyone!

I was wondering if any of you would like to give your feedback on this security scanner my team and i have finished working on recently?

It&#39;s basically a programme that scans PHP code and suggests how to change it if it spots an issue and it&#39;s currently in beta. 

Obviously who is better to find out if something actually does its job than a second (or more) pair of eyes that are trained for this sort of thing.

I&#39;m not a cybersecurity specialist so i come to you lads, lasses and the rest -- help us out please?

I&#39;d really appreciate it if you could check it out [here](https://phpsecure.net/landing) and leave any feedback you may have in the comments to this post! 

Massive cheers!</description>
