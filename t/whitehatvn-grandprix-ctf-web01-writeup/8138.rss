    <title>Whitehatvn Grandprix CTF - Web01 writeup</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/whitehatvn-grandprix-ctf-web01-writeup/8138</link>
    <description>This weekend we participated in Whitehatvn Grandprix CTF and this is one of the 2 real challenges we managed to solve.
Big thanks to @anon3236228 for executing exploit while challenge was officially down, 
getting us flag quicker (and for being help in brainstorming).

Description:
manhndd is running a service file upload at 
web01.grandprix.whitehatvn.com, 
it is restored every 2 minutes. Every 1 minute after service starts, he ssh into server to check /var/secret. Can you get it?

Writeup:

After visiting provided website we are presented with upload page running SimpleHttpServerWithUpload.py, it didn&#39;t ask for any particular file type and didn&#39;t check extension.
I saw other players trying to upload various shells without success so I decided to inspect upload functionality closer.

I used [Burp Repeater](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/repeater_using) which is nice tool for easily and quickly changing your requests and getting results back.
After uploading test file we are presented with following message:

![burp-web01-2|690x387](upload://iL1RjYnLjz78tVj09bnErw8MhF1.png)

So we know our files are saved in /opt directory, I tried to go one directory up by modifying filename parameter to &quot;/../test&quot; 
which resulted in &quot;Couldn&#39;t save file , are you sure you have right permissions?&quot; which means that upload is vulnerable to [directory traversal](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Path_Traversal)! But we can&#39;t write anywhere, first thing I tried was writing to /tmp:

![burp-web01-3|690x387](upload://wkGREn1FVrrE8AU7rZsW4QFfoIe.png)

Great, but not very useful , we can&#39;t even read file we uploaded :( . I unsuccesfully tried to write a cron file, and even had crazy
ideas about exploiting service by writing to something in /proc/self/ but it resulted in nothing. Then I reread description again:

`**manhndd** is running a service file upload at...Every 1 minute after service starts, **he ssh into server**...`

Of course! It should be possible to write to home directory of this user and overwrite his [.bashrc](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/129143/what-is-the-purpose-of-bashrc-and-how-does-it-work) file which is executed every time he logs in.
Test file first:

![burp-web01-4|690x387](upload://9iQs3i6ezGLCxlNTEAK6LPlruMz.png)

Awesome, write was successful but how to get a flag out? After few attempts of using netcat we realized outbound connections were blocked
so we decided to write to /opt which we seemed to have access to:

![finalscreenshot-web01|690x387](upload://qmXWDqyibUy30w3YMDbHMJUQawb.png)

And it worked! Flag could be found at web01.grandprix.whitehatvn.com/shellPyhscript :D</description>
