    <title>RFC: What makes a tutorial a tutorial?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/rfc-what-makes-a-tutorial-a-tutorial/1249</link>
    <description>Hi 0x00&#39;ers!

Discussion on the IRC has posited this: _There are tutorials, and then there are cheatsheets._

__Cheatsheets__ provide basic information, a simple, short how-to.

__Tutorials__ are significantly more in-depth, and they provide the _why_&#39;s of a topic.

0x00sec is lucky enough to have _both_ on this site. What we do want to know, however, is how to handle _cheatsheets_, since they aren&#39;t really _tutorials_.

### Should we do something about this?
[poll]
- We should separate them.
- We have cheatsheets?
- Keep it as is.
[/poll]

The above poll is preliminary, and the site Leaders would greatly appreciate any comments/discussion below.

EDIT: The above assumes that __both__ tutorials and cheatsheets are accurate with respect to their content.</description>

            <p>That’s a good idea! The reference category might just be the place for them!</p>

            <p>This is my take. We should separate them; put them in the references subcategory. Since they are references.</p>
