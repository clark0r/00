    <title>Science that doesn&#39;t deal with computers</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/science-that-doesnt-deal-with-computers/1397</link>
    <description>Confession: I love science. I love blowing crap up. I love experimenting. Lately I&#39;ve gotten into playing with home brewing and baking as a way to learn more about biology and chemistry. Yeast is fun. Sugar is interesting. Beer is good.

So 0x00, let me ask you: Do any of you have science hobbies outside CS/infosec/crypto?</description>

            <p>I remember trying to make a drug resistant Legionella strain. I boiled the infected water later though, without knowing if I have been successful or not.</p>
<p>If I have any outside CS hobbies? Well does electronics count?</p>
