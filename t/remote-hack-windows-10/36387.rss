    <title>Remote hack windows 10</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/remote-hack-windows-10/36387</link>
    <description>Hi, I hope you are doing okay.
I have a question please, I am new to hacking, and I learned a few stuff on TryHackMe, I learned how to exploit and run a &quot;malware&quot; one windows 7 just by using the IP adress of the windows 7 and finding a vulnerability. But I was unable to do the same on my second windows 10 pro PC, do you have tips please ?

Thank you in advance

            <p>hi<br>
to be honest i didn’t understand quite well what u did right there but from what i understand you found a vulnerability on an outdated version of windows 7 and was able to exploit it so i very much doubt that you’ll find the same vulnerability on windows 10.<br>
or if you generated a malware and sent it to a machine running windows 10 you may wanna check if the payload you used is compatible with windows 10 or if it is able to bypass windows defender etc.</p>
<p>hope it helped</p>
