    <title>Linux for Beginners</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/linux-for-beginners/3120</link>
    <description>Hey guys my name is Adam and I am brand new to the area of linux and pentesting in general. I am starting my journey in pentesting by learning linux and some of the tools that pen testers use. 

I came across this site while looking for labs to do online and thought I would share it. If it has already been talked about then mods feel free to remove it. :slight_smile: Like I said I am brand new to learning linux and to this community. I look forward to learning from all of you and I hope to one day give back as well.
