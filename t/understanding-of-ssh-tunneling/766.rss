    <description># Introduction 
Today&#39;s Tutorial will teach you how ssh Tunnels  work. This is not a Hacking Tutorial ( but you can use the Knowledge you will have for hacking : make socks proxy or stay on a target machine with reverse ssh). SSH Tunnelling will help you to access services behind a Nat or a Firewall.

Well, it&#39;s time to talk about SSH

# What is ssh ?
Here what is ssh ( thank to our good friend **Wikipedia** ) 
&gt; Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.The best known example application is for remote login to computer systems by users.

&gt; SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client-server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server. Common applications include remote command-line login and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH. The protocol specification distinguishes between two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2.

SSH help you secure your connection between two host. This is a really good protocol if you want to avoid man in the middle attack ! 

# How to connect to a machine behind NAT / Firewall

Here a little network diagram 

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/c44243c27eae4bdb0d016ef4831c88eb3cc475e6.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;156&quot;&gt;

The server block ssh connection so you won&#39;t be able to acces your the server from home. 
What we will learn is to do a reverse ssh Connection, the server will connect to a public server and then you will be able to ssh to the server 

Here are the step to connect to the server who is behind a firewall : 

*  forward the port 22 of the E-CorpServer to the port 1234 of your server 
* Connect to your server from home
*  Connect to the E-CorpServer from your server 

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/ccca7c5d2d9cb7fe972ff80bbd9900db570d5278.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;279&quot;&gt;

The E-CorpServer will connect to your server through ssh and do a remote port forwarding 
E-CorpServer -&gt; hackerserver:22 
then Forward port 22 to hackerserver:1234

Your home machine will connect to hackserver

home -&gt; hackserver:22
and then 
hackserver -&gt; localhost:1234

# Accessing the internal Web Server of E-Corp

Here the story : 

You have succefully get a root shell on the E-CorpServer, you use the reverse ssh to be able to connect from home but you want to acces the web internal web page from your browser 

Here what you should do : 

*  forward the port 8080 of the E-CorpServer to the port 8080 of your server 
* forward your local port 80 to the remote port 8080 of your server 

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/a4135d6a70386563247dc73cad299ad55757d300.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;212&quot;&gt;

And you will be able to browse their internal web server : )

Hope You understand how ssh tunneling work ! 

# About the Nebula Serie 

Here a poll for you to decide if I stop the nebula serie or if I do something else
[poll]
- Stop the Nebula series
- The Series is good ! I want more tutorial 
- We want Tutorial on android Malware ! 
[/poll]

See you for my Next tutorial ! : )</description>
