    <title>Send raw requests via sockets</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/send-raw-requests-via-sockets/30670</link>
    <description>I want to create a proxy server on sockets, ready-made solutions are unlikely to work because I already have a connection that is always open and which will receive raw requests like:

`CONNECT www.example.com:443 HTTP/1.1` 
or
```
**GET** /search?q=test HTTP/2
Host: www.bing.com
User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
Accept: */*
```

To send raw requests via sockets I need to parse ip and port, even then I&#39;m not sure it will work.
Are there any solutions to make this work?</description>

            <p>Yeah, like <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/notaghost">@notaghost</a> made a good point: we sort of need to know what kind of thing you’re trying to build to give more feedback. I think that you want to build a TCP proxy to intercept traffic and debug it? If so, there are a number of premade SOCKS proxies that you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://ma.ttias.be/socks-proxy-linux-ssh-bypass-content-filters/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Geniar (2017)</a> discusses using SSH to create a SOCKS5 route to (mainly to bypass web filtering but can maybe be applied to your situation).</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Wireshark (n.d.)</a> is a “go to” utility for intercepting network traffic and can be used to capture traffic flowing through your NIC.</li>
<li>This one’s a bit old, but <em><a href="https://nixbit.com/software/spike-proxy-review/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">nixbit (n.d.)</a></em> lists the infamous SPIKE Proxy which is used to fuzz network-based software through (obviously) a proxy.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to write your own SOCKS proxy, I recommend both <em><a href="https://rushter.com/blog/python-socks-server/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Golubin (c.a. 2018)</a></em>'s tutorial or <em><a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781718501133" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Seitz &amp; Arnold (2021, pp. 19-26)</a></em>'s section in their book on their black hat Python book.</p>

            <p>Could you share a bit more about what you’re trying to build? What is going to be connecting to this server?</p>
<p>Edit: In the mean time, an article like this might give you a place to start? <a href="https://inc0x0.com/tcp-ip-packets-introduction/tcp-ip-packets-3-manually-create-and-send-raw-tcp-ip-packets/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">TCP/IP packets - 3 Manually create and send raw TCP/IP packets - inc0x0</a></p>
