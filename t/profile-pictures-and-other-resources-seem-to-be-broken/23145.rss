    <description>Hey all, sorry for my absence!

It&#39;s great to see that this community is still up and running! The nostalgia rush I&#39;ve gotten from reading through some old and new posts on here last night was intense! :smiley: 

I&#39;ve noticed that some resources in old posts and profiles don&#39;t display photos anymore. I&#39;ve attempted to attach screenshots to this post however, when doing so I got a popup saying &quot;access denied&quot;. Is there a problem with the service being used to store the uploaded images? Why are some pictures not affected by this? And most importantly, how can I help?

Thanks for your time!

            <p>Hey there, sorry to hear about the bug!</p>
<p>I’m currently stretched a little thin with work ramping up and uni starting soon but if there’s something I can help with, I’m just a message (or email, email’s probably quicker) away!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>Hey man - we had a huge issue with a discourse bug that wiped out a bunch of images in our bucket a few months ago - sadly we lost them <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>There are still a few bigger projects we have outstanding that will include a full server migration and we will iron out a lot of the other image bugs there. I’m not happy about it - but as a team of volunteers with little bandwidth we’re trying our best.</p>
<p>I know this isn’t the best answer to hear, but we have a plan to fix the remaining little bugs and we’re fully aware.</p>
<p>Thanks man!</p>

            <p>This might be a dumb suggestion but due to the fact that pictures are usually used for illustration purposes and sometimes to show snippets of code, it might be a good idea to temporarily remove the option to insert or upload images to try to help convince everyone on this site to post code snippets in text instead!</p>
