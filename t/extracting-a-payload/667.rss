    <title>Extracting a Payload</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/extracting-a-payload/667</link>
    <description>as @0x00pf explained in his [ELF injection tutorial](https://0x00sec.org/t/elfun-file-injector/410/19), you can extract the .text (actualy code) from an ELF (binary) file to get the payload.
There are many ways to do this and picoflamingo showed us one way.
Today I will share a shell script I wrote that does the same thing and prints it in ascii on your terminal, or wherever you redirect / pipe it.

```
#!/bin/bash
xxd -g 1 -s `h2d $(objdump -h $1 | grep .text | awk -e &#39;{print $6}&#39;)` $1
```
That&#39;s all, it&#39;s pretty short, but can be very functional for shellcode development.
You can check `man xxd` for more options to change it&#39;s output format.

Hope it&#39;s of any use to you !

I forgot to include h2d, it&#39;s a C program I wrote :slight_smile:

```c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int indx = strlen(argv[1]) - 1;
    int i,j=1, sum = 0;
    for(i=indx;i&gt;=0;i--,j*=16) {
        if(argv[1][i] &gt;= &#39;0&#39; &amp;&amp; argv[1][i] &lt;= &#39;9&#39;)
            sum += ((argv[1][i] - &#39;0&#39;) * j);
        else
            sum += ((argv[1][i] - &#39;a&#39; + 10) * j);
    }
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, sum);

    return 0;
}
```

After compiling you need to put it in your path, you can do this by moving it to /usr/bin, or make your own path folder, put the program in there and then update your PATH variable.
The best way to do this, is to add the addition in ~/.bashrc

`export PATH=&quot;$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin:$HOME/.path/&quot; # Add RVM to PATH for scripting`
You will find this liine in your .bashrc probably if you have RVM installed. As you can see I added the folder .path to it
Else put in the line:
`export PATH=&quot;$PATH:$HOME/.path` (if your folder is at ~/.path.)
After doing that, either restart your terminal or use: 
`source ~/.bashrc`</description>

            <p>You can also add it in .bashrc, ofcourse h2d needs to be in your path<br>
(I use ~/.path/)</p>

            <p>This however I have found works much nicer IMO.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#!/bin/bash
objdump -d ./$1|grep '[0-9a-f]:'|grep -v 'file'|cut -f2 -d:|cut -f1-6 -d' '|tr -s ' '|tr '\t' ' '|sed 's/ $//g'|sed 's/ /\\x/g'|paste -d '' -s |sed 's/^/"/'|sed 's/$/"/g'

</code></pre>
<p>Actually gives you the shellcode.</p>

            <p>OH MAN! YES! I have been forever trying to find a decent way to do this. Well, not forever, but I spent a hard 15 minutes of googling before I gave up xD</p>
<p>Thanks a tonne, going straight in my ~/Bin/ <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I’ve named it shellstract!</p>
