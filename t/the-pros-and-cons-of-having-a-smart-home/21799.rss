    <title>The pros and cons of having a smart home</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/the-pros-and-cons-of-having-a-smart-home/21799</link>
    <description>So my family wants to install a smart home (lights, temperature, and garage). Think Vivint, Alexa, etc. 

So I would like to hear some arguments for and against smart homes. I do understand that there are many cases of said being hacked but if there were ways to make it secure how can the smart home become secure? It seems like most iot devices are insecure imo.</description>
