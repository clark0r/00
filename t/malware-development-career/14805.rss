    <title>Malware Development Career</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/malware-development-career/14805</link>
    <description>Hello guys! I am a rookie in cybersec field and I have a deep interest in Malware Development. Currently learning and progressing towards being a Penetration Tester because it seems demanding and also looks fun. But later on, I&#39;d really like to shift into Malware Development if there&#39;s actually a career path for that field. Can you help me with this? I&#39;m not asking where or how to learn malware dev. I&#39;m just asking, Where I can find jobs If I become a good malware developer? Is there a legal niche for it, or is it just an underground field?</description>

            <p>For my site:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read Team tooling</li>
<li>Governments</li>
<li>Governments organisations especially military</li>
<li>Private organizations that want to get rid of the competition</li>
<li>You can also look for reverse engineer and malware analyst companies that develop that kind of tooling and services.</li>
</ol>

            <p>Maybe some government agencies might be interested, but you probably have to be really good.</p>

            <p>The most obvious that I can think of the tooling for Red Team engagements. On defense, malware analysis is also viable.</p>
