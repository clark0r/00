    <title>What&#39;s new in 0x00sec?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/whats-new-in-0x00sec/629</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been ghosting a while and haven&#39;t been actively working on anything infosec related for a while (Thanks Udemy) but what kind of projects are underway here?

Possibly mid-july I&#39;ll wrap up my studies and return to working on scripting tools with Python but I&#39;m really not sure. There are so many things to do, from CTFs to CCNA prep to experimenting with every single tool in Kali Linux (Gonna take a while with this one).

I might just open a professional blog and just talk about stuff, but not sure how that would play out. Anyways I&#39;ll try to be more active in this community within the coming month!

            <p>Awesome! Great to hear your studies are coming to a close, being able to wrap up your work of several years is surely satisfying.</p>
<p>At the moment we are working towards getting a CTF underway, which should be really good. Afaik, <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/oaktree">@oaktree</a> is working on minimum spanning trees and a lot of algorithm stuff, meanwhile <span class="mention">@unh0lys0da</span> is working on a multi-platform Elun-File injector.</p>
<p>So theres a lot of activity here. <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/0x00pf">@0x00pf</a> is also killing it with his content.</p>
<p>Things are doing really well right now.</p>
