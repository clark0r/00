    <title>PentesterLab questions</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/pentesterlab-questions/16163</link>
    <description>Hi everybody!

I couldn&#39;t find PentesterLab topic around here. Since I&#39;m having a lot of trouble solving most of the White badge exercises, I hope someone here could answer questions regarding it, and give some advice or clue in right direction. There aren&#39;t many write-ups or tutorials on the internet for Pro exercises, and I&#39;m having trouble scoring exercises online (ISO versions are somewhat easier to solve). I have even contacted owner of the site on several occasions, and he gave me clues on how to solve particular exercise, which is something not everybody would do (and I&#39;m extremely thankful for that!). This would of course happen after spending 2-3 hours on exercise (with or without watching video tutorials), and researching online.

Currently I&#39;m stuck on Pickle Code Execution exercise, netcat connection hangs (server timeout), and I haven&#39;t been able to issue command over it. I&#39;m looking for another way, using Burp Suite, but Python scripts I have found online didn&#39;t work in my case.

Maybe I&#39;m missing some details, and we (beginners) could help each other make some progress in this lab. :)

Thanks in advance!</description>

            <p>Finally managed to solve it, what did the trick was hitting Enter after base64 code, before semicolon, otherwise I would get different response from server (no completion):</p>

<p>What I don’t get is why this works, shouldn’t it work anyway, with or without new row in Burp?</p>
<p>Hope it helps someone!</p>
