    <title>InfoSec and Artificial Intelligence</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/infosec-and-artificial-intelligence/427</link>
    <description>hello 0x00sec members!! This is my first post so i will do my best not to make it too complicated.
First i want to clarify that I&#39;m no expert in either AI or InfoSec so if i give any false information please let me know.

In this post i will give a brief introduction to both Artificial Intelligence and InfoSec fields and then show some uses of AI in InfoSec.

**Artificial Intelligence:**
Artificial Intelligence is the field of computer science with creates algorithms that make machines exhibit intelligence.

**Information Security:**
Information security is the practice of keeping information either in electronic or physica form safe from any unauthorized access.

You might be wondering, well how do i combine AI with InfoSec?

* intelligent algorithms can be used to identify and automatically response to cyber threats.
* AI-based algorithms could provide instant feedback of any malicious activity within a network.
* intelligent systems can predict cyber attack and automatically defend the network

Those are just some uses I thought if you have any other ideas please let me know. The field of InfoSec could benefit a lot from Artificial Intelligence as long as we make sure we don&#39;t create a real-life Skynet. Thank you all for reading this post I&#39;ll do my best to improve next time.</description>

            <p>As I posted before, AI can be used for password cracking, by the same token Im sure (while un-researched) could be used to create more efficient password generation/encryption. but, <em>shrugs</em> I require more pylons.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to the advances in AI based infosec. Here is an article briefly describing some experimental antivirus software that utilizes deep learning to identify and prevent malware.<br>
