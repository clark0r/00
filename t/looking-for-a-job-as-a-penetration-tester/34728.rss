    <title>Looking for a job as a penetration tester</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/looking-for-a-job-as-a-penetration-tester/34728</link>
    <description>Hi!

My name is Choi, I&#39;m 30 years old, working as a system administrator, writing websites in my spare time.
Stuck in the ceiling of the routine, caught in the ceiling of the salary at the main job, I want to change the field of activity (options - vorker and ubiver do not offer!).
Who needs an assistant/partner whose glass is more than empty than full in regards to pentesting, or if there are uncomplicated tasks, I&#39;m open to suggestions.
