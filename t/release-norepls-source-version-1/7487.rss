    <title>[Release] NoREpls Source - Version 1</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/release-norepls-source-version-1/7487</link>
    <description>Hey guys, as you may or may not know, I developed an application dubbed &quot;NoREpls&quot; for the purposes of teaching Windows reverse engineering as a side project. It&#39;s been a while since its debut here so I&#39;ve decided to finally upload its source on my GitHub page here: https://github.com/NtRaiseHardError/NoREpls. The code currently contains the latest changes (part 6).

For those who are interested in the potential continuation of `edgyReggie`&#39;s development adventures and the NoREpls series, please vote if you want to see more and/or leave a reply to suggest a relatively simple application.
