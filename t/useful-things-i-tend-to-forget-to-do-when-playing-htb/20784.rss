    <title>Useful things I tend to forget to do when playing HTB</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/useful-things-i-tend-to-forget-to-do-when-playing-htb/20784</link>
    <description>HTB is a great place for anyone to practice their hacking skills. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a beginner or a seasoned security professional, it has all sorts of machines to challenge your skills. After spending many hours, trying to root as many boxes as possible, I observed that I tend to forget some good practices or certain techniques and commands that would make my life easier and I thought of making this little article.

## OSINT

With that, I mean the general concept of OSINT and looking for clues and solutions.

* It&#39;s always important to **note any user you come across** while browsing a website, as it may be useful for later use. A user ``Carl Smith`` that wrote an article on that box may have an account with the username ``csmith`` or ``c.smith`` or ``cSmith`` etc. If you come across a password with no username, chances are Mr. Smith is your guy.
* **Do some research on the box&#39;s creator.** This may sound as a cheat, **but**(!) see it this way: when you&#39;re doing a pentest and you want to do a spear phishing attack, you have to know your target, right? 
Many creators get in the process of creating a box just because they have an article about a technique to escalate privileges or a CVE under their name. Search for their blogs, their Github profiles and maybe even Twitter(?)!

## Read ``.bash_history``
Probably 99% of the boxes have it like that: ``.bash_history &gt; /dev/null``. Nevertheless, once you&#39;re in the box, it only takes you half of a second to check. In real-world environments ``.bash_history`` can contain juicy information, like *&quot;accidental passwords typed after unsuccessful sudo&quot;* as mentioned this [privilege escalation reference guide - Wiki](https://0x00sec.org/t/the-ultimate-privilege-escalation-reference-wiki/9788) in 0x00sec. Although I get it why ``.bash_history`` gets redirected to ``dev/null/`` here in HTB. If it wasn&#39;t, I would be getting root just by waiting for someone to enter the commands for me!

## $ ``sudo -l``
I really don&#39;t know why, I just forget it. But you shouldn&#39;t!

## Enum, enum, enum
I can&#39;t stress that enough. **Enumerate as if you&#39;re about to get root.**
Yeah, sometimes things are clear as daylight, e.g. having a machine that uses a web server that is vulnerable  to RCE. But most of the times it&#39;s not and HTB wants you to suffer. 

## Frustration is your enemy
This can be a note to myself for every time I get stuck in a box. No, vict0ni, the box doesn&#39;t want to mess with you. Neither does the creator. **Take a step back, review your findings and the situation, and try again.** This, of course, is not limited for playing HTB but it&#39;s a good general tip for hacking and coding.

## Don&#39;t avoid Windows boxes
**You can&#39;t avoid the inevitable.** Windows were, are and will be a big part of the world of computers. Although it&#39;s boxes doesn&#39;t always have the most realistic environments, I tend to see HTB as a practice for the real world and a very good preparation for OSCP. As I lack of knowledge for Windows, I can only get better at it by practicing. As @pry0cc said:
&gt; Eat your vegetables!

(If you&#39;re like @Baud, replace the word &quot;Windows&quot; with &quot;Linux&quot;)

### Now go hack!

            <p>Well, you are totally free to use any distro / system you like.<br>
But yeah Kali/Parrot are nice, because they come with tons of tools preinstalled and it saves you a lot of time, because you can easily kill and respawn the VMs. You could also create your own image with tools you like.</p>
<p>But I would recommend to do this in some automated manner. It is mostly a pain to do all the setup all over again.</p>
<p>TBH, I mostly use only a very small set of tools for HTB.</p>
<p>My goto tools are mostly</p>
<ul>
<li>nmap</li>
<li>Burp</li>
<li>gobuster</li>
<li>fuff</li>
<li>sqlmap</li>
<li>SMBmap</li>
<li>searchsploit</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite" rel="nofollow noopener">LinPEAS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/" rel="nofollow noopener">GTFOBins</a></li>
<li>Some note taking app</li>
</ul>
<p>And then depending on the machine maybe some other tools.</p>

            <p>Understood. Thanks. But why parrot or kali? I know they come with lot of tools but do we use all of them?</p>

Well, it is recommended. You will access the HTB network via VPN (openvpn). You could connect with your normal system, however it is not recommended. I mean you connect to a network full of hackers, that will totally scan your system.</p>
<p>So to stay safe it is always better to connect inside a VM. Setup parrot or kali and you’re good.</p>

            <p>Hey, great post, and when it comes to <code>.bash_history</code> being redirected to <code>/dev/null</code> is so the box creators don’t forget to remove some important confidential information such as potential passwords. Think this is another good reason.</p>

            <p>This is great!</p>
<p>I’ll add one I forgot too many times when I started HTB: specifying port ranges in an nmap command with <code>-p-</code>.</p>
<p>Gotta check all the ports. If you don’t, you might miss something important. And you’ve got plenty of time, so don’t make the mistake of spending hours on a box and not getting an entry point because you didn’t check obscure ports.</p>

            <p>HTB is a great place for anyone to practice their hacking skills.

After spending many hours, trying to root as many boxes as possible, I observed that I tend to forget some good practices or certain techniques and commands that would make my life easier and I thought of making this little article.</p>

<p><strong>You can’t avoid the inevitable.</strong> Windows were, are and will be a big part of the world of computers. Although it’s boxes doesn’t always have the most realistic environments, I tend to see HTB as a practice for the real world and a very good preparation for OSCP. As I lack of knowledge for Windows, I can only get better at it by practicing. As <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a> said:</p>
