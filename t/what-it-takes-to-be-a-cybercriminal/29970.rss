    <title>What it takes to be a cybercriminal?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/what-it-takes-to-be-a-cybercriminal/29970</link>
    <description>First of all, I want to thank this community for existing. I am so glad I found this forum, and I can&#39;t wait to read what is in here!

I really wonder what it takes to be a cybercriminal? What knowledge should you have and what cyber crimes should you participate in, in order to identify as a cybercriminal?

Also what should I do in order not to be considered a script kiddy? I purchased countless guides on HF and telegram with intentions to make money with black hat hacking. &quot;How to run a mining botnet&quot; , &quot;Click fraud for beginners&quot; , just to name a few. Yet I never made a single cent. And when I ask what I am doing wrong, the most often answer I get is : &quot;You are just a skid&quot;.

I am really interested in the topic of running a mining botnet, so if anyone could comment some guides or learning materials I would be really glad!

Thanks in advance, and stay safe!</description>
