    <title>What you think about CTF365?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/what-you-think-about-ctf365/581</link>
    <description>With our upcoming CTF and other exciting things coming to 0-Sec I&#39;ve decided to research more on CTF&#39;s and I came across CTF365.com, I created a user and found out they&#39;ve got a pretty neat setup on CTF activities and more. My question to you fellas, is what do you guys know about this site and would it be cool setup a fortress and add members to it and test our skills against other top notch security experts?</description>

            <p>Thanks for the heads-up, definitely gonna look into that site, sounds like a great training ground.</p>
<p>As for your question, if there would be the possibility - including organization and funding - to start a 0x00sec-CTF Team on that site, I would love to partake in it.</p>
