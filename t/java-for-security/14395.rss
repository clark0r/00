            <p>Can we just… not use Java? Can we bury it already?</p>

            <p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/c0wm1lk">@c0wm1lk</a> , Java is widely used, especially in older desktop applications, so if you can read it, it’s great, you might spot some issues in the source code, but what I can see, is people are moving away from Java, it’s not considered trendy these days (on android it’s Kotlin - which is amazing btw - web is dominated by javascript, with php, javascript, python or rarely java backends).</p>
<p>C/C++ is in my opinion well paying, and is good for practicing security related stuff. PHP is also good for security, it’s still very common (statistics say around 40-50% of web), and often contains issues you can exploit.</p>
<p>In general, I think the key is to know the basics of programming, and then check out different languages to get familiar with the syntax. From there, with the help of Google, you’ll be fine with almost any language.</p>

            <p>I can’t comment on Java because I do not know it. However it seems to be a widely used language all around the globe and thus it’s good for getting a job.</p>
<p>I however recommend that you learn C/C++, it’s great for learning more about security and the job market is also pretty damn big. In my observations C/C++ seems to be more widely used than Java.</p>
<p>However learning a programming language and mastering it is the most important step, no matter which language.</p>
