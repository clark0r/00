    <title>The Hackers EDC bag</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/the-hackers-edc-bag/1651</link>
    <description>Hello fellow 0x00sec h4x0rz!! Today I&#39;m coming to you with a discussion topic on EDC bags. An EDC bag is something that you carry with you every day, I.E, an &#39;E&#39;very &#39;D&#39;ay &#39;C&#39;arry bag.


----------

## The Bag.
Alright, so, what&#39;s an EDC bag without the bag part?! Personally, I don&#39;t think you need an expensive, super high tech backpack...Now, with that said, I prefer the [Razer tactical pro backpack](https://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-tactical-pro-backpack) ($159.99).
&lt;img src=&#39;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/8/895d3667823727124369e2c0c275d44fd560909f.png&#39;&gt;
It&#39;s got pockets for all your tech, and a main compartment for a laptop with room for more tech. :smile: Plus, there&#39;s an underside compartment with a weather proof cover for the bag. I mean, built in weather proofing?! What&#39;s not to love?


----------

## The stuff inside
Now that we have a bag, what on EARTH are we going to put inside of it?! Well, there&#39;s a boatload of options, and honestly it all comes down to personal preference. Here&#39;s a list of things that would go in my EDC bag:

**Non-Destructive Entry:**

1. [Lock picks](https://www.amazon.com/Narrowser-Package-Leather-Titanize-Scissors/dp/B019DN9GVS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487401764&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=lock+picks) and [shims](https://www.amazon.com/10pcs-KLOM-Padlock-Picks-Accessories/dp/B013JS7BS8/ref=sr_1_27?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487401739&amp;sr=8-27&amp;keywords=lock+picks), because what&#39;s a hacker without a little bit of non-destructive entry?! Very useful for when you get locked out of (or in) things. (Varies)

2. An [EDC Hall Pass](https://acehackware.com/collections/everyday-carry-edc/products/edc-hall-pass?variant=1131982416) from ACE Hackware. Need to get into a room without using picks or destroying your banking card or drivers license? This is your tool. Fits right on in your wallet too. ($10.00)

3. The [Proxmark3 RDV2 Kit](http://hackerwarehouse.com/product/proxmark3-rdv2-kit/) for sniffing, reading, and cloning RFID tags. Useful for things like non-destructive entry and social engineering. ($300)

4. Some [T5557 RFID](http://hackerwarehouse.com/product/t5557-readwrite-125khz-card/) cards for your Proxmark3. ($30)

**Wireless:**

1. At least two [Alfa AWUS036NH](https://www.amazon.com/Alfa-AWUS036NH-802-11g-Wireless-Long-Range/dp/B003YIFHJY) WiFi adapters. Why two you ask? Well, for things such as rogue APs. You never know when you will have to try and catch someone doing illegal stuff on their network! ($39.99)

2. A [Yagi WiFi Antenna](https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Directional-Antenna-Booster-Connector/dp/B00VK0FFKO/ref=sr_1_10?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487405839&amp;sr=1-10&amp;keywords=yagi+wifi+antenna) for when you need to access a network from afar. ($13.83)

**Hardware:**

1. A small wireless keyboard like the [Rii mini](https://www.amazon.com/Rii-Wireless-Keyboard-Touchpad-Control/dp/B00I5SW8MC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487410352&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=mini+wireless+keyboard). ($17.99)

2. A [USB hub](https://www.amazon.com/Sabrent-4-Port-Individual-Switches-HB-UMLS/dp/B00BWF5U0M/ref=pd_sim_147_4?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B00BWF5U0M&amp;pd_rd_r=G0868T0RTA9KM4413S6W&amp;pd_rd_w=XnlbI&amp;pd_rd_wg=bGkl8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=G0868T0RTA9KM4413S6W) for when you need more usb ports [Don&#39;t we always need that? Get 5 or 6 of these to be sure rofl]. ($5.49)

3. A [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-RASPBERRYPI3-MODB-1GB-Model-Motherboard/dp/B01CD5VC92/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487406007&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=raspberry+pi+3). Who needs a laptop when you can have this?! But no, seriously, stick this in a building and netcat to it from home or build a [portable hacking station](http://www.lifehacker.co.uk/2015/10/30/build-portable-hacking-station-raspberry-pi-kali-linux) with it [I plan on building mine into a silver briefcase :smile:]. (Around $30)

4. An [Arduino](https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-Uno-R3-Microcontroller-A000066/dp/B008GRTSV6) because everyone has one, and there&#39;s so many uses for them. For example, need to get in your friends hotel room but dont kave a key? Do [this](https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/James-Bond-s-Dry-Erase-Marker--The-Hotel-PenTest-Pen/). ($16.06)

5. A [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html) because again, everyone has tone, and they&#39;re insanely useful. As an example, here is Samy Kamkar&#39;s [USB Driveby](https://samy.pl/usbdriveby/) tool that utilizes the Teensy device. ($19.80)

6. A [laptop](https://www.google.com/search?q=Laptops+for+sale&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8). I&#39;ll leave it up to you to figure out a reason as to why we would need something like this. ;) 

7. A [toolkit](https://www.amazon.com/Oria-Precision-Screwdriver-Magnetic-Smartphones/dp/B01IVKPTP6/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487413126&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=cell+phone+adapter+set) for fixing things, because sometimes things break in the most untimely situations. ($29.99)

**Miscellaneous:**

1. Literally _anything_ from Hak5&#39;s [Hakshop](https://hakshop.com/). Like, seriously guys. They have some really cool gear. Notably, their [field kits](https://hakshop.com/collections/hak5-field-kits), [LAN Turtle](https://hakshop.com/products/lan-turtle), and [WiFi Pineapple](https://hakshop.com/products/wifi-pineapple?variant=11303845317). (Varies)

2. A USB drive with [Katana](http://www.hackfromacave.net/katana/index.html) on it for a plug-n-play security suite. (Varies)

3. [Password Reset Key II](https://www.amazon.com/Recovery-Password-Better-Windows-Versions-7/dp/B01BO6604S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487411955&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Password+Reset+Key), for recovering your lost windows password. Works on any version of windows from 95 and up. ($19.99) _I got mine for $5 on amazon, so look around. Better prices will pop up._

4. A high capacity [power bank](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZQ4JQAA/ref=twister_B01AI55GD2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1) for your phone, Raspberry Pi, or Arduino. ($29.99)

_I ALWAYS carry numbers 2 &amp; 3 on a necklace, as I use them quite frequently._

----------

## That&#39;s all folks!
Now, I&#39;m sure I forgot some things that you guys may feel is necessary and 100% not optional to have in an EDC bag. Things like an SDR dongle or heatsinks. But the reality is that more often than not, I don&#39;t need those things. Although when I do, I bring them along. Remember, this is supposed to be an Every Day Carry bag!

_Keep in mind, this is simply what I would put in my EDC bag. This isn&#39;t a catch-all list and it&#39;s meant to prompt ideas for your bag, not for you to duplicate. (Although you very well may if you so wish)_

**Discussion questions:**

1. What are some things you would put in your EDC that aren&#39;t on this list?

2. Do you have an EDC bag already?

3. Are you enjoying your time here at 0x00sec?</description>

            <p>Hey everyone, I’ve got an addition for this! I figured that sometimes people wouldn’t be able to carry a raspberry pi around with them because that would make them seem quite odd and out of place, especially if you were in an engagement. Instead, you could carry around a tablet with <a href="https://www.kali.org/kali-linux-nethunter/" rel="nofollow noopener">Kali Nethunter</a> installed!  I recently received a Nexus 7 tablet for Christmas and went ahead and threw CyanogenMod &amp; Nethunter on it. I gotta tell you, I’m absolutely loving it!</p>
<p>Here is the tablet I got (though I would actually recommend either the Nexus 10 or the OnePlus One phone)<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nexus-Google-7-Inch-Black-Tablet/dp/B00DVFLJDS/ref=sr_1_3?tag=0x00sec03-20" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.amazon.com/Nexus-Google-7-Inch-Black-Tablet/dp/B00DVFLJDS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514322145&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=Nexus+7+2013+tablet</a></p>
<p>EDIT: Also, due to the inability of being able to edit my original post, here is a new link to the<a href="https://www.razerzone.com/gaming-accessories/razer-tactical-pro-backpack" rel="nofollow noopener"> Razer Tactical Pro Backpack</a> because Razer decided it would be okay for them to update their website <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:">  Happy Hacking!</p>

            <p>Since some of us are teenagers earning $40 a week, there’s a backpack I just ordered that I think, serves my purposes:<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N4GS58L/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?tag=0x00sec03-20" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N4GS58L/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a></p>
<p>Ok yes it isn’t as cool as:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-tactical-pro-backpack" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-tactical-pro-backpack</a></p>
<p>but I can put anything in it that I need. Including but not limited to:</p>
<p>My zombie apocalypse battery pack:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07653HP6P/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?tag=0x00sec03-20" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07653HP6P/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a></p>
<p>My Raspberry Pi, my 15.6" Dell Laptop, Lock Picks (link is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DWZ8-Locks-Tools-Training-Set/dp/B07544GX2L/ref=sr_1_3?tag=0x00sec03-20" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>), My wireless headphones, Screwdriver, My beautiful Arduino, etc.</p>
<p>(If this is necrobumping my apologies).</p>

<p>We <strong>always</strong> have a “get out of jail free card” when we’re doing physical security assessments or red team engagements. If the cops are called, you need to have evidence that you are doing this legally.</p>
<p>If the client doesn’t own the entire facility, we’ll coordinate with the building management when doing a physical security assessment or red team engagement.</p>

            <p>Very interesting read! The bash bunny is new to me, but looks very useful! <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> In your opinion, how does it compare to the <a href="https://inversepath.com/usbarmory" rel="nofollow noopener">USB Armory</a>? Do you have any experience with it?<br>
Spec wise, the USB Armory has a newer CPU. Also, with it’s micro SD card slot it seems to be more expansible. I didn’t find the dimensions of the bash bunny, but from the pictures it looks more bulky. Can you confirm this?<br>
I’m looking forward to hearing your opinion on that! <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>If any of you folks are interested in what I carry for my red team engagements:</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Entry tools are not legal everywhere. Before I go on an engagement, I make sure I know the relevant laws.</strong></p>
<h2>Bag</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.goruck.com/gr1-rucksack-black-/p/GEAR-000574" rel="nofollow noopener">GoRuck GR1</a> - This bag is tough as nails, and big enough to carry all the gear I need. Whether I’m sneaking in late at night, crawling under fences, or talking my way into an office, I carry everything I need. It’s not flashy, so it doesn’t draw unwanted attention.</p>
<p>Important caveat: It has limited internal organization, so you need to buy additional pouches to keep your gear organized.</p>
<p>#<span class="hashtag">#Tech</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/" rel="nofollow noopener">MacBook Pro</a> - No red teamer is complete without a trusty laptop. The build quality of the MacBook is second to none, even though I don’t know if I’ll buy the newest model. I have a 13" rMBP. It’s light, powerful enough to run my tools and a couple VMs, and solid enough that I know I won’t break it. Also lasts for ~8 hours on battery; you never know if there will be a power outlet.</p>
<p><a href="https://hakshop.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe" rel="nofollow noopener">USB Rubber Ducky</a> - Always take advantage of unlocked workstations. I take three with me on engagements; and set them up to deliver the appropriate payloads for the target environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.ryscc.com/products/new-proxmark3-kit" rel="nofollow noopener">Proxmark3</a> - Used to clone RFID badges. Can’t break into an area? Clone an RFID badge and use that to get in. Not always cooperative, but always useful.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-20100-Capacity-Technology/dp/B00X5RV14Y?tag=0x00sec03-20" rel="nofollow noopener">Anker PowerCore 20100</a> - Always have extra power for your phone or other mobile devices. The Anker PowerCore is up against the allowed limit for batteries you can take with you on an airplane, at 20,100 mAh. This will keep your devices charged for days.</p>
<p><a href="https://hakshop.com/products/bash-bunny" rel="nofollow noopener">Bash Bunny</a> - Newly released, but incredibly useful. This is a very dangerous device, the big brother to the USB Rubber Ducky.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/802-11g-Wireless-Long-Rang-Network-Adapter/dp/B0035GWTKK/?tag=0x00sec03-20" rel="nofollow noopener">Alfa AWUS036NEH</a> - The standard for wireless hacking. Cheap enough that you can afford to break one, and works with every OS out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wifipineapple.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">WiFi Pineapple</a> - A lot of people consider this a script kiddy tool, but it’s very useful for real red teaming as well. Karma attacks, wireless sniffing, MitM capabilities… You can be dangerous with one of these.</p>
<p>Flash drives - You never know when you’ll need to move files around. I keep at least 2x32GB flash drives with me.</p>
<p>External hard drive - Big enough to keep backups of my laptop if anything goes wrong. Never used for client data.</p>
<p>#<span class="hashtag">#Entry</span> Tools<br>
<a href="http://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/underdoor.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">Under-door tool</a> - Not a very well-known tool outside of the physical security space, but it’s incredibly useful in most office environments. Gets you into practically any lever-handled door, locked or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Compressed-Air-Dusters/b?tag=0x00sec03-20&amp;node=3012916011" rel="nofollow noopener">Compressed air</a> - If you think there will be doors with REX (request to exit) sensors, compressed air is a simple way to trick the sensor. Turn the can upside down, and spray a cloud of cold propellant to trick the sensor.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/doubletap.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">Snap gun</a> - My picking skills aren’t the greatest, but this makes up for that (somewhat). If I don’t want to take the time to pick a lock, and I can afford a bit of noise, this is a quick way to pick certain locks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.southord.com/Lock-Pick-Tools/Lock-Pick-Set-14-Piece-PXS-14.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Lockpicks</a> - Lockpicks are sometimes necessary to get into a target facility. I’m no pro, but I always keep a set with me on engagements.</p>
<p>#<span class="hashtag">#Miscellaneous</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Cover-Large-Ruled-Notebook/dp/B00CNSVZ4M?tag=0x00sec03-20" rel="nofollow noopener">Notebook</a> - Always be ready to write important details down, whether or not your laptop is out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prosvet-Cree-XML-Portable-Flashlight-Adjustable/dp/B019KMO79I/?tag=0x00sec03-20" rel="nofollow noopener">Flashlight</a> - Always have a small, bright flashlight. When you’re operating at night, you may need to see where you’re going. Also helps if the power goes out.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.ryscc.com/products/t5577" rel="nofollow noopener">T5557 RFID Cards</a> - These cards allow you to emulate low-frequency RFID badges. These are what you write cloned badges to.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.ryscc.com/collections/tags/products/mifare-uid-chinese-magic-card" rel="nofollow noopener">Mifare Chinese Magic Cards</a> - Sometimes you’ll come across an organization that makes use of high-frequency Mifare RFID badges. These cards are rewriteable Mifare cards that let you clone Mifare badges.</p>
<p>That’s pretty much everything that I carry with me on my engagements; if I come up with something that I’ve forgotten, I’ll be sure to add it in.</p>
