    <title>How to access sites that try to force an app down your throat when you&#39;re on Android</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/how-to-access-sites-that-try-to-force-an-app-down-your-throat-when-youre-on-android/1482</link>
    <description>Short article, but sometimes you&#39;ll find that sites force you to download an app to access certain content, for example Facebook, 9GAG etc.

This is easily solved:

Download Firefox on Android from the APP store
In firefox change the useragent string.
HOW: http://www.howtogeek.com/113439/how-to-change-your-browsers-user-agent-without-installing-any-extensions/ Scroll down to Firefox, I believe the Chrome one doesn&#39;t work.</description>

            <p>There is, but those sites don’t care about that.<br>
All they care about is the User Agent string.<br>
Also request desktop might change the user agent string, but not sufficiently, it still won’t think you’re on a PC.<br>
Haven’t tried it on iOS.</p>

            <p>Isn’t there the option ‘Request Desktop Site’ on every major Android/iOS browser? <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  (This should change the user agent, it isn’t persistent as your solution though)<br>
P.S.: Tried about:config on Firefox on iOS and it didn’t work</p>
