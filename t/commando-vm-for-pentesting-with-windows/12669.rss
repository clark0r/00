            <p>So what I did on both the physical machine I installed CVM on and the virtual machine was I installed <a href="https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm" rel="nofollow noopener">flare-vm</a> on top of it. I also installed <a href="http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php" rel="nofollow noopener">mingw-x64</a> and <a href="http://www.smorgasbordet.com/pellesc/" rel="nofollow noopener">Pelles-C IDE</a> among a bunch of other debuggers and decompilers that were not installed by default. I don’t personally like using chocolatey for installing new programs though, I don’t know why. Maybe it’s just because I’m old</p>
<p>I personally like having both a virtual machine (obviously) and a physical system. The physical system boots a lot faster due to being on raw hardware while the VM is useful for malware analysis because you control the environment, can rollback, can clone, can edit the existence of every instance you create to your hearts content easier than the raw hardware counterpart.</p>
<p>Of course this is just my personal opinion like saying geany is better than notepad++, or using pulma over gvim</p>

            <p>After testing this a little, it’s definitely better on a VM. You can install it straight to the physical machine, but during the install it disables a lot of security features to make the installs go smoother.</p>
<p>Also, if you run into issues, being able to rollback to snapshots really helps.</p>

            <p>Installed it last night and slept while it was installing. I took a peek at the installation script which is pretty much a powershell script, but hey… it works. Anyways, pretty much the script uses boxstarter (<a href="https://boxstarter.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://boxstarter.org/</a>) which after reading what it is on their site, choco is like a repo on Linux which are used for apt and installing packages and dependencies.</p>
<p>Personally, this seems like a great idea and I am kind of impressed?</p>

            <p>I see, well I don’t like bloat that much so I’ll probably hold off on this one.<br>
But I did check out what tools they have and I don’t know all of them, so I’m just going to use it as a reference point to learn more pentester tools.</p>

            <p>its not a VM image or ISO, its meant to be installed on a win10 or win7 VM you already have provisioned, so yeah the name is a bit inaccurate</p>
