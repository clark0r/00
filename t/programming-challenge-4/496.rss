    <title>Programming Challenge - #4?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/programming-challenge-4/496</link>
    <description>Hello, I am back  with another fun and quick little challenge for you programming enthusiasts who want to expand their knowledge and love toying with some fun exercises. The below program I wrote in java but I would love to see it in other languages as well! Good luck and have fun!!!
:toilet: Toitlet :3

Design a Java program using arrays and methods that reads standard student grades as a number from 0 to 100 for two 2 exams and 3 assignments in your &quot;CIA&quot; class(I&#39;m a terrible joker... 0.0). 

1)_Ask the user for the number of students and then request the numeric scored for the exams and assignments for each student. You may use a general number like 1 or 2 etc. to identify students. 
2)_For the output, show the average grade for each student as a percent value of all exams and assignments and the equivalent letter grade.

                                       Good Luck!</description>
