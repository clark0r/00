    <title>C# Scanning Project</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/c-scanning-project/14228</link>
    <description>A **C#** scanning project?!

Yeah i know C#.. A odd programming choice, but I am doing this for a University project.  The project brief is to create a Windows desktop application in either UWP or WPF.

I started this degree as my lack of development skills was holding me back, what have I learnt.. that i suck at programming. 

I have just started this project and I am looking for some assistance and guidance as this is a bit of a step up from last year.

The idea of the project is that my network scanner will scan a class C network for live hosts and then conduct a port scan. Think Nmap... if it was really really shit.   I cant see this tool being used by the community, due to 1. This is made by an amateur and 2. there wont be as much functionality.

Now I would like to add some enumeration stuff in, but as I have to hand it in this around November time it is unlikely that i will be able to do this.

-----------------------------------------------
TO-DO:

*Finish off navigation UI -- Cant seem to go to my other dynamic pages. 

*Scanner -- Absolutely no idea where to start on the scanner, seen loads of stuff online for multiple programming languages and for a console use, but nothing that could help me on a GUI desktop design.
----------------------------------------------
I have been using GitHub here: https://github.com/W4KEY/WpfRecon. 

Any advice, links, ideas, codes snips would be very welcome.</description>

            <p>Some great ideas here, thanks!</p>
<p>In the first instance I will have to agree on <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/dtm">@dtm</a> and focus on my basic minimum requirements… this way I at least will get a pass.</p>
<p>I do however like the idea of adding a map and perhaps using some api’s!</p>

            <p>Probably don’t. Focus on getting a basic, minimal working product before adding features. If you’re not used to programming, you may end up spending a lot of time coding poor implementations and design patterns. You might also end up wanting or having to re-code different parts for better code reuse or optimisation.</p>

            <p>If I was you - I’d focus on trying to do something that distinguishes this from other scanners.</p>
<p>Maybe a way to plot results out on a map, or a tree view, visualising results with contextual information like ipinfo, shodan, greynoise, and application fingerprinting using the wappalyzer api.</p>
<p>There is a lot of stuff that scanners like Unicornscanner and Nmap don’t provide. I’d love to see that in an application, even as a PoC.</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>So i have seen the two examples you have provided, but they are console based and require a lot of customisation.  I started on the Github link you provided but it was so heavily customised i could not get it to work.</p>
<p>So the other interesting thing on this project… UWP has blocked ICMP! so as part of the <a href="http://system.net" rel="nofollow noopener">system.net</a> networking library there is no ping… it is not officially documented anywhere, looks like Microsoft didn’t want any scanners on their marketplace.  Due to this I went with WPF.</p>

            <p>That should be a pretty fun project. I like c# a lot actually. The GUI design should be pretty easy but I would look at examples of port scanners (here’s <a href="https://jonlabelle.com/snippets/view/csharp/simple-c-open-port-network-scanner" rel="nofollow noopener">one</a> I found, and here’s <a href="https://github.com/munirusman/Simple-TCP-Port-Scanner/blob/master/PortScanner/PortScanner.cs" rel="nofollow noopener">another</a>). I’d imagine you just arrange the initial scan however you like and then run the live hosts through the scans in a loop. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net?view=netframework-4.8" rel="nofollow noopener">system.net namespace</a> will probably be quite handy. I’d also consider what platform they want this to run on, as that will matter for you choosing either UWP or WPF.</p>
