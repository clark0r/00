    <title>Question about bypassing timed router shutdown</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/question-about-bypassing-timed-router-shutdown/27408</link>
    <description>Hello, I have a question about how I can bypass the fact that the router where I am staying shuts off on a timed basis (from 23:00 to 05:00.) I cannot pentest due to my lack of a monitor mode card. Is there a way to get around this? Or a way to create an extra access point to bypass this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.</description>
