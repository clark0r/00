    <description>Hello 0x00&#39;ers! To help drive discussion and encourage contributors, we are introducing a weekly &quot;contributor of the week&quot; award, which will be known as &quot;l33t of the w33k&quot; :stuck_out_tongue:  

We (moderators) will read through the posts and topics and assign up to two awards for the best quality and most frequent contributors. We will also add your name to a board where the past weeks awards will be stored. 

*When will this get posted?*
The results to the weeks contribution award will be posted on the Friday of the week. This will recur each week unless we feel we need to change it. 

*What can I do to increase my chances?*
We are looking for quality posts, and discussion. If you get a decent amount of likes, and a decent amount of comments (excluding issue posts) it will likely place you in the ranking. Questions asked are valued a lot as well, anything that drives discussion is likely to increase your chances of receiving this award!

Good luck! We look forward to reading your posts :)
