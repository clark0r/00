# Writeup CTF 0x00sec Web - Exercise #6

Another day, another ctf challenge. This time we try no. 6.

## The Challenge

This time, if we visit the page we are welcomed with an error message. That our IP is not on the whitelist. However, let&#39;s start like we always do:

By inspecting the source code of the page.

![01-source|626x500](upload://mmITJ8VT7HmbyEi79Hx2gHFpjDU.png) 

And we instantly find our hint:

```html

&lt;!-- TODO: --&gt;

&lt;!-- * Test IP whitelisting security --&gt;

```

## The Attack

Well, we know that there is an IP Whitelisting in place. And that it might be flawed. But to be honest, I had no idea how to bypass this.

My initial idea was to abuse exercise 5 for this. As we know that it had an SSRF we could try to access the page of exercise 6 with it. But that sadly did not work out.

But Google is your friend and after googling for _ ip whitelisting bypass_ I found a nice article: [https://www.sjoerdlangkemper.nl/2017/03/01/bypass-ip-block-with-x-forwarded-for-header/](https://www.sjoerdlangkemper.nl/2017/03/01/bypass-ip-block-with-x-forwarded-for-header/)

That sounds nice. So our target is the [X-Forwareded-For](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Forwarded-For) header.

And as `127.0.0.1` should never be blocked we have our exploit. So let&#39;s curl the page and add the header with `-H`

```html

curl -H &quot;X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1&quot; https://exercise-6.0x00sec.dev/

```

And we see the page content and the flag!

## Conclusion

Never give up against a firewall.
