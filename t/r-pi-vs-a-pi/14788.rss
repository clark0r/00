    <title>¿R-Pi -=vs=- A-Pi?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/r-pi-vs-a-pi/14788</link>
    <description>A few months ago I was excited to come across a piece of hardware comming in as a contender to challenge the chokehold Raspberry Pi seemed to be forming on the market. The major selling point was seeing the name Intel included. I recall seeing the Edison board at an electronics store 6 or 7 years ago, but the reviews I read told me my funds would be better spent elsewhere.

With the new raspberry pi 4 dropping, I was wondering if anyone has had the pleasure of playing with both of these, and how they stack up. 

I gotta say, that I like the fact that the Atomic has quite a few different models for devs.


Base specs are pasted below

Atomic-Pi
https://dlidirect.com/products/atomic-pi
* Genuine [Intel Atom x5-Z8350](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/atom_x5/x5-z8350) quad core with 2M Cache. Runs up to 1.92GHz with a 480MHz GPU.  Eats RPi for dessert.  Beats some desktops.  
* Loaded with memory: 2GB DDR3L-1600, 16GB eMMC, SD slot for adding more - up to 256GB
* Full HDMI port with Intel HD Graphics &amp; primary audio out
* USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 ports
* Fast dual band WiFI b/g/n/ac 2.4 &amp; 5GHz WiFi [RT5572](https://www.mediatek.com/products/broadbandWifi/rt5572) IPX connectors on board
* Bluetooth 4.0 [CR8510](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/csr8510) 
* Gigabit hardwired RJ45 Ethernet [RTL8111G](https://www.realtek.com/en/products/communications-network-ics/item/rtl8111g) 
* Peripheral 9-axis inertial navigation sensor with compass [BNO055](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/products/all_products/bno055) 
* Secondary XMOS audio output with class-D power amp.
* TTL serial debug and expansion serial ports up to 3.6Mbps
* Real time clock &amp; battery
* JST style connectors on top and a 26-pin header for power &amp; GPIO below. 
* Runs on 5V. Typically 4-15 watts.
* Legitimate licensed BIOS boots from SD, USB, or Ethernet. Linux comes preloaded... Yes, it&#39;ll run Win10 32 or 64.
* **Large full breakout shield available**  with screw terminals for easy wiring, or order just the CPU and provide your own wiring.

            <p>Seeing the side by side size comparison, combined with the odd GPIO power supply might be a bit of a deal breaker indeed.</p>
<p>I looked into the LattePanda that he mentioned, carries quite the price tag, but the titan case looks sleek.<br>

<p>Unfortunately, the boards themselves seem to bounce from 200 - 400. Unfortunately my funds top out at 25 schmeckles when it comes to my toy projects right now.<br>

<p>Thanks for throwing that up there.</p>
<p>Edit: Found a $90 version on the site. Still a bit high, but wouldn’t want someone who skims the post to next the idea based on the numbers I have up.</p>

            <p>Originally I was excited about the Atomic Pi, but I think this video showed me it might not be everything I am looking for in a SBC.</p>
