    <title>Looking to make a RAT, but how can I make it without ports?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/looking-to-make-a-rat-but-how-can-i-make-it-without-ports/7257</link>
    <description>Alright, so hear me out.
I can make a RAT with a free program, like Nanocore (Which sucks, I know), but the problem is, how do I get an open port to do so? I have an open port with my ISP, but I hear I can get in trouble for ratting with it, so is there a way to do this without using a paid for VPN? I know VPNs have open ports, but I don&#39;t wanna pay for one.</description>
