    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/gaining-domain-admin-from-outside-active-directory/5722</link>
    <description>So, I am again up with a new article to share. It is a great write-up by Rob Brown. It is about penetration testing an Active Directory. This is useful for the penetration testers who are into internal penetration testing.
