    <title>How I Stole imguʀ.com And Pwned The World</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/how-i-stole-imgu-com-and-pwned-the-world/1807</link>
    <description>I was up early, checking my twitter feed, and I came across [this](https://www.vgrsec.com/post20170219.html).

They were a bunch of guys who decided to take letters in a domain name, and convert them to unicode. So they look visually the same, although they are actually completely different. I decided to give this a go.

# Hot Damn

I hopped over to the [Hompglyph Attack Generator](http://www.irongeek.com/homoglyph-attack-generator.php), put in imgur, and found a close enough match. Then I hopped on over to my favourite registrar and registered it. 

Here is what it looks like i.imguʀ.com/ai8sch.jpg

Don&#39;t worry, there isn&#39;t some sketchy 0day or IP logger on there. I promise. I&#39;m from the internet, you can trust me.

You may notice that when you copy and paste that into your URL bar, it will automatically resolve to i.xn--imgu-jdc.com, that in fact is the domain I actually registered. These are known as unicode domains. They are supported by major browsers. A legitimate use of these would be emoji&#39;s in the url. 

I picked Imgur as people often use it to share images over IRC. If you throw in a link without a https:// prefix, they will just copy and paste it.

In fact, I tried it in the IRC and several people tried the link. It looks pretty innocent and would catch many people out. Thus, I hope this short overview of the potential for this attack is enough to help you keep your eyes open! 

Keep Nullin&#39; :stuck_out_tongue:

            <p>Hello there, first of all: Excellent read, great PoC! Very informative.</p>
<p>I decided to test how the domain name interacts with emails and will post my results below:</p>
<p>(By “Nickname” I am referring to the “Name” you could select, in this example it would be “<a href="mailto:noreply@i.imgur.com">noreply@i.imgur.com</a>”, the supposed email of the actual domain owner.)</p>
<p>Gmail:<br>
- Preview shows the “Nickname”    eg: <a href="mailto:noreply@i.imgur.com">noreply@i.imgur.com</a> (non-unicode, the ‘actual owner’ of the domain)<br>
- Actual mail shows the “Nickname” and the Unicode email eg: <a href="mailto:noreply@i.xn--imgu-jdc.com">noreply@i.imguʀ.com</a> (unicode)</p>
<p>Outlook:<br>
- Preview shows the “Nickname”<br>
- Actual mail shows the “Nickname” and the translated email eg: <a href="mailto:noreply@i.xn--imgu-jdc.com">noreply@i.imguʀ.com</a></p>
<p>AOL (lol):<br>
-Preview shows the “Nickname”<br>
- Actual mail shows the “Nickname”, when you press “Show details” it displays the translated mail eg: <a href="mailto:noreply@i.xn--imgu-jdc.com">noreply@i.imguʀ.com</a></p>
<p>IRC (Weechat):<br>
- <a href="http://i.xn--imgu-jdc.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://i.imguʀ.com</a> actually displays the url correctly, you can even click on it directly</p>
<p>Discord:<br>
- The URL displays correctly, and when your unicode domain, redirects to the original domain in the DNS records, the preview lists the preview of the original domain<br>
(When the DNS records do not redirect to the original site, it displays the spoofed preview, for example the <a href="http://i.xn--imgu-jdc.com" rel="nofollow noopener">i.imguʀ.com</a> preview, displays pry0cc’s preview page)</p>
<p>Edit: Added Discord results.<br>
(I hope I wasn’t too confusing, if anything is unclear, feel free to ask me for more info!)</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Melanu</p>

            <p>The big caveot is that when you click it, it turns into the actual domain. So it misleads to the click, after that it may not function too well.</p>
