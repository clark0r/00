    <title>The anonymous hotmail mail : Follow up after 1 year</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/the-anonymous-hotmail-mail-follow-up-after-1-year/34352</link>
    <description>Hello, 

This post i actually going to be a follow up on my cry for help from about a year ago (so better to read to history first :) (Painfull as it is for me to read how deep i was that time :( )
https://0x00sec.org/t/can-you-find-out-who-send-an-anonymous-hotmail-com-mail/29808

After this mail, we more or less gave up and tried to rebuild our lifes and confidence. Afterall, it seemed impossible to ever get to the bottom of this case.

That was untill yesterday. All of a sudden the IP-trace mails gave a result. 
Not the kind I wanted, because the returned IP didn&#39;t give me any info
The registered IP-adress is: 34.86.177.154

But I&#39;m clueless about what happened... did the anonymous mailer reopen his account (which I&#39;m 99% sure was an account created with the sole purpose to send the mails, and was never used afterwards)?
Or is this a kind of automatic generated mail, what hotmail removes inactive account after a year?</description>

    First of all, thanks for reading this, i guess it will be long and boring, post <img width="20" height="20" src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title="slight_smile" alt="slight_smile" class="emoji"> 
I find it quite difficult to know where to start without going into too much unnecessary (and private) details, but i guess that if i want you to be more or less intrigued by my story i will have to put it out here. 
As my name already has given away, I’m spending quite some time in and around the swimming pool, be it as a coach, official, member of the board or parent. This is also where my story sta…
