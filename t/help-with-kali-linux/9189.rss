            <p>My biggest suggestion is to try out HackTheBox.eu.</p>
<p>Go there, make an account, and get a VIP pass, it’s really one of the best platforms for beginners to learn how to use their tools properly in a legal environment.</p>

            <p>There is no substitute for hands-on learning. Check out <a href="https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges</a>. One of the things that is really great about it is that many of the challenges have links to useful learning resources (docs, talks, blog posts, ect). Once you complete a challenge I highly recommend looking at the submitted solutions to see how others have done it. I’ve personally learned quite a bit from that.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other useful sites too. There are some great “awesome lists” on github. <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#security" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#security</a> is a really good list. There are more resources there than you could reasonably get through. Just follow your interests.</p>

            <p>First of all welcome! Secondly I have to something right away. There won’t be ‘someone’ that teaches you how to use (Kali) Linux.<br>
Especially Kali Linux is meant as a penetration testing system, hence it includes a ton of different tools for different tasks…</p>
<p>If you would have searched a bit you would have found the <a href="https://www.kali.org/download-kali-linux-revealed-book/">kali linux revealed book</a> that probably is a decent start if you really want to know about Kali Linux. If you want to learn penetration testing and utilize the tools there are other ways to learn …</p>
