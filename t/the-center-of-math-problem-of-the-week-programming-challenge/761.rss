    <title>The Center of Math - Problem of the Week [Programming Challenge]</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/the-center-of-math-problem-of-the-week-programming-challenge/761</link>
    <description>Hey mates,
this time just a short post about Center of Math&#39;s problem of the week, which I think could be a sweet programming challenge.

---
## The Exercise
&lt;img src=&#39;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/be8213a194d778c6915faa6a033831b9055e023e.png&#39;&gt;

I thought of a brute-forcing program, which calculates the different positions of the 3 hands and tests if they overlap. This challenge could be a bit difficult, but maybe some of you have fun trying it :grin:. I&#39;m currently working the whole time on my Android RAT, so I can&#39;t give you an example solution, but I think it shouldn&#39;t take that long for the great members here to fill this hole ;).

Of course the solution isn&#39;t that hard to find - just think about it -, but this challenge is a bit more math-oriented and reactivates your spirit :slight_smile:. You can find the original post [here](http://centerofmathematics.blogspot.de/2016/07/problem-of-week.html).

            <p>Firstly, not only 00:00:00 is the correct solution. 12:00:00 works too ;).<br>
Secondly, as <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/0x00pf">@0x00pf</a> said, an alog clock doesn’t care about milliseconds and in the original post from the Center of Math they just speak about hours, minutes and seconds, so these should be enough <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">.</p>

            <p>Actually an analog clock works using gears that, in a sense, are imposing a minimum step on the clock hands. In a sense,  it is digital deep inside <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> . Not sure if mechanical analog clocks can go down to miliseconds, but I would say most of them don’t <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>

            <p>Actually, I think if you follow <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/0x00pf">@0x00pf</a>’s logic, you only get the answer 00:00:00 when you’re not looking into milliseconds.</p>

            <p>I kind of got trapped by this, because I immediately thought of a program to solve the problem, without thinking how an analog clock actually works <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=9" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"> Though, there wouldn’t have been so much programming fun with just one solution. Anyway, thanks for the heads up! <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/thumbsup.png?v=9" title=":thumbsup:" class="emoji" alt=":thumbsup:"></p>

            <p>Nice challenge! As <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/oaktree">@oaktree</a> said, it would be easier to do without code. Although it would be something good to practice if you can make a program off of information you receive from text.</p>

            <p>I think that you have to consider the space between the marks in the clock. The key word is <strong>analog.</strong> As the second-hand advances, the minute-hand moves from one minute to the next one. As the minute-hand advances the hour-hand moves from one hour to the next one.</p>
<p>Therefore, 3:15:15 is not a solution to the problem. When the seconds-hand is at 15, the minutes-hands will be a quarter advanced with respect to the mark, and also the hour-handle that will be also one quarter off. Becase in three more quarters it has to be in 4.</p>
