    <title>IIS6.0 Vulnerability</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/iis6-0-vulnerability/2414</link>
    <description>Hi folks

After shadowbroker leaked NSA tools, I started to work around them and tried to find out what exactly the tools doing and fix vulnerable systems.

I&#39;ve tested most of the exploits that are in FUZZBUNCH and others that could found in leaked data.

Now, it is around 3 days that I am on EXPLODINGCAN and working on it. I got what it is, but, HERE COMES PROBLEM

Let me explain what i did:

&gt; Run FUZZBUNCH -&gt; set target host [external host] -&gt; set local [ddns address that routes traffic to us] -&gt; set redirection to NO -&gt; Use explodingcan -&gt; execute

After I did this, the module was executed and it gave me the below messages:

    webdav is enabled

    .

    .

    .

    exploit complete

    explodingcan succeeded


    Connection to target established

    waiting for next stage

Then I used command &quot; session &quot; and there was the ready session that was connected to target.

After some search, I found MSF module that can be used instead of EXPLODINGCAN in this [LINK](https://github.com/zcgonvh/cve-2017-7269).
In the readme file has been shown that after executing module, the MSF should send stage to target, but when I hit ENTER, nothing appears, just below things

    [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 0.0.0.0:44446
    [*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.



My questions:
1) If connection established in FUZZBUNCH, Why the shell does not exist?
2) How can I get the shell from the session that its status is ready, in FUZZBUNCH?
[ As we know when we have the session in MSF we can get the shell from that with command &quot; sessions -i &quot;session_number&quot; ].
3) The EXPLODINGCAN module asks for &quot; HOSTSTRING &quot;.
What is exactly that?
The IP address of Google is &quot;216.58.206.14&quot;, so if Google is our target, the hoststring should be google.com?
4) In the FUZZBUNCH - EXPLODINGCAN, what is next stage after exploitation?</description>

<li>In the FUZZBUNCH - EXPLODINGCAN, what is next stage after exploitation?</li>
