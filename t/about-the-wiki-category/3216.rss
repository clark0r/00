    <description>Wiki&#39;s are a great way to share information, make it open for people to edit, and contribute, and soon with many hands you&#39;ll have light work.

Wiki&#39;s are also a much cleaner way of storing references, as they can be updated by anybody, and improved or added to, rather than just creating an endless stream of reference posts.</description>
