            <p>According to my knowledge, that/what you are trying to do is not possible without “WPA Enterprise”.<br>
and cert installation always remains pain for every connected client.</p>

<p>i still confused in proxy part, <img src="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=15" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> is burp will run on wifi server or specified ip ?,</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Multiple ways for doing this, first way is ARP poisioning and second way is use your machine as router i.e bridge two interface one for connection to the internet and second for connection for clients. This is up to you how you design Network Architecture.</p>

            <p>so yeah, my plan is :</p>
<ol>
<li>I’m the owner of the wifi, and if someone want to connect to my wifi, they must install my cert (redirected to download .pem / cert file, and android will automatically open cert installation popup),</li>
<li>after client connected to my wifi network, and my cert already installed, so yeah, i can retreive the http/s data</li>
</ol>
<p>and i still confused in proxy part, <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> is burp will run on wifi server or specified ip ?, and i’ll use raspberry pi for this</p>

            <p>If your device’s android version is greater than 7.0 (i think) then you need to root your device and only after that you can install certificates on system level.<br>
Install Magisk Manager and use “trusted credential” module for this.</p>
<p>For your second question I recommend Burp. Set proxy port to 80 and then you don’t need to set proxy on connected device. But you need to install cert as I mentioned above via Magisk.</p>
