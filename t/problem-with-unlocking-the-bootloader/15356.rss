    <title>Problem with unlocking the bootloader</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/problem-with-unlocking-the-bootloader/15356</link>
    <description>Hello to everyone !!!!!

I don&#39;t know if this is the right section to post but ,I have an Archos Access 45 4g device with android Nougat 7.0.
I&#39;m trying to unclock the bootloader but when I run &quot;fastboot oem device-info&quot; or &quot;fastboot oem unlock&quot; I get three dots that waiting forever !
I have already enabled the option &quot;Oem Unlock&quot; from Developer options. Still getting those dots that you see in the picture below!

Thank you very much !!!!!</description>
