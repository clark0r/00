    <description>I’m a total beginner and don’t know much about the cyber world. I don’t know how to protect myself from cyber theft either. I never intended to enter this world but for very very legitimate reasons I just had to search for someone that can carry a hacking service for me. Obviously I know this isn’t done for free but I was shocked with the amount of scammers that claim that they can get the job done for me! Luckily I have been very careful so far. I read online that the only place I can find true hackers is the deep/dark web. However it’s very risky to enter without proper protection! I need to know if there is anyone here that can guide me on this matter and how to get it done step by step</description>

            <p>Oh dear this is too much information for me to understand! No I can not get access to this persons phone or computer… it’s only the WhatsApp that I need to hack and nothing else… I know that hacking is illegal but not everything we do in life is legal plus there are always very legitimate reasons that I’m not even worried if this person finds out later… I saw a tutorial on YouTube about some spy applications but I’m not sure if they’re some sort of scam or what?! I know I’m not supposed to download every application on my devise unless it’s verified … in conclusion, I think I’m better off looking for some professional that can get the job done for me … I just don’t know where to look…</p>

            <p>To login on whatsapp you probably need SMS verification, so you need access to phone of that person in order to get the verification code from SMS. Anyway if you will get access to phone then you have access to everything <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
I dont know much about android or ios, you can for sure create backdoored APK for android and somehow get this person to install it. Or maybe there are some other ways, creating phishing sites (fake whatsapp site, person will use it to login to her his account, you get the credentials, use these credentials to automaticly login, this person will get   SMS with code, and again will type it in, which means you get the code, since its your fake site blah blah blah).<br>
Too much effort, too little to gain i guess. But you can try. Depends how much you wanna get access to this account.<br>
I think getting access to this persons computer would be easier for you.<br>
BTW, Informations above are purely educational, accessing someones devices without this person consent is illigal <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Good Luck</p>
