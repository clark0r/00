    <title>Need Help with Port Forwarding</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/need-help-with-port-forwarding/32406</link>
    <description>My Router has these settings:
1)Dynamic IP
2)Static IP
3)PPTP
4)PPPoE
5)L2TP

**Now currently 4 is selected.**

The router shows:
IP address: 10.x.x.x
Gateway: 104.x.x.x
LAN IP: 192.168.x.x

But when I enable port forwarding for my local LAN machine (192.168.x.x) through some port yyyy. I can only make use of this IP address 10.x.x.x but not the gateway IP 104.x.x.x which looks like the public IP. 

 So how can I port forward my public IP across the Internet ?</description>
