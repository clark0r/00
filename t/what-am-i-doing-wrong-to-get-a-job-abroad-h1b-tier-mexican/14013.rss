    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/what-am-i-doing-wrong-to-get-a-job-abroad-h1b-tier-mexican/14013</link>
    <description>I am trying to move another country , but as I know H1B or TIER visas sometimes are not easy to get. I have some experience in red team operations , and penetration testing.  I have been ~4 years in this field with 2 workable year. Until now, I mainly worked as a Penetration tester &amp; red team member.  I started sending my resume to job-related advertisements as a penetration tester, a junior security consultant , red team member , vulnerability research over `indeed` , `linkedin` . So far without any luck.

- Ethical Hacker 9 mos PwC
- Penetration Tester 1 yr 2 mos Company Name 
- Security Programmer Company Name 3 months(project)

I also have been ex employee mostly 5 months , but I have been using my free time to learn vulnerability research , and exploitation, I also paid OSCP cert , but I didnt finish(PWK only, I need to take OSCP 24 hours chall to earn the cert) because I was focusing on vulnerability research
