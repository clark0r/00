    <description>[Trail of Bits&#39; CTF Field Guide](https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/index.html)

I think this has been out there for a while. I searched this site and couldn&#39;t find anything for this, so I apologize if I am repeating something.

This thing is like a full course....extremely interesting.

BTW, I would recommend some understanding of C, specifically pointers and memory management.</description>

            <p>Oh yeah, I remember seeing this CTF Guide when I wasn’t very interested in CTFs. Now I’m very interested in them and this would be a nice resource. Thanks for sharing</p>
