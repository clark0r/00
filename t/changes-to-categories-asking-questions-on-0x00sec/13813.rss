    <description>Hello 0x00sec!

There seems to be a bit of confusion about the site and where certain things should go.

To clear up this confusion, we have renamed the Support category to Questions. 

If you want to post a question, post it in the Questions category. This will suppress it from showing up on the main page, as many people viewing the site are trying to read articles or things that inform them. 

You can see questions articles by going to the &quot;New&quot; button on the top bar. 

If you post a question in anything other than Question, then your post will be unlisted or moved to that category. Of course - discussion topics may still be posted in Social &gt; Discussion. 

Hope this clears things up!</description>
