### [Realistic challenge 8](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/8/)

#### Message:
&gt;Hey man, you gotta help me out, Gary Hunter, one of the richest men in America, has just deposited $10,000,000 into his bank account at the United Banks Of America and plans to donate that money to a campaign to hunt down and lock up all hackers. Now I&#39;ve tried hacking their site but I&#39;m just not good enough. That&#39;s why I need your help, Here&#39;s a list of your objectives:
1. Find the account of Gary Hunter (I don&#39;t know his account name).
2. Move the $10,000,000 into the account dropCash.
3. Clear The Logs, They&#39;re held in the folder &#39;logFiles&#39;.
I really hope you can do this, because if you can&#39;t we&#39;re all screwed



#### What can we extract from the message?
Well this time the message was so nice to format the objectives nicely already, so for the sake of completion:

* Find the account of Gary Hunter (I don&#39;t know his account name).
* Move the $10,000,000 into the account dropCash.
* Clear The Logs, They&#39;re held in the folder &#39;logFiles&#39;.


### The site:

Another simple interface with a few functions implemented.
Also some pictures..
&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/42b4c5725700ef5b5e7cdb62f7f9bd1da1969ba1.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;432&quot;&gt;

### The source

When looking at the source we can easily identify important .php scripts like
the **login.php** and the **register.php** as well as what they expect in terms 
of input..

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/8/8281073f88c1dda5f8bd4dedd8cd449d12b5cd95.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;175&quot;&gt;



### The &#39;hack&#39;
[spoiler]

Okay first let&#39;s try registering a new account to find out more about the internals.

Look at this we got access and directly can see the other functions we have to use

* transfer money -&gt; **movemoney.php**
* delete logs -&gt;  **cleardir.php**

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/9/9d537c158903b405fcd7034d6b65c338b814207a.png&quot; width=&quot;483&quot; height=&quot;75&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/c/c6a12118e1fcab54cff437728f1e682f9eec7890.png&quot; width=&quot;492&quot; height=&quot;69&quot;&gt;

Anyway the &#39;hack&#39; here now includes [cookie forgery](https://paladion.net/cookie-forgery-part-1/). 
We can look at our cookies in the developer tools in our browser..

Okay let&#39;s check if we can get this cookie as an output through javascript injection.
Let&#39;s try this in our browser:

    javascript:alert(document.cookie);


And voilá.. The site is vulnerable to this..

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/8/8306407e8c8531cbf8b59395add0fd5fc38c4984.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;94&quot;&gt;


Okay let&#39;s look for the account in question here. Let&#39;s use the search:
Just looking for Gary Hunter didn&#39;t reveal any users so let&#39;s try to dump the whole userbase.
Time for some SQL injection in the search field:

    &#39; or &#39;1=1&#39; 


And voilá again.. We can find GaryWilliamHunter here as a user. So what now?

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/a/ab0f5da90dd7cb0f546dbd4baa9ec4d31a1b91c4.png&quot; width=&quot;635&quot; height=&quot;499&quot;&gt;


But hey! Remember the cookie thing?
Let&#39;s edit our own cookie with the credentials from our bro Gary.
Now let&#39;s try to move cash with our forged cookie..

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/0/044f7e4ddd0741daf4f6f37ca233d68f1a4e7b04.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;257&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/e/ea58e27f9c9c33c4adc83e29e1d78f0f7bc086ab.png&quot; width=&quot;549&quot; height=&quot;146&quot;&gt;

Works like a charme :O


Time to delete the logfiles for part 2 of the task!
Login again. Check the &quot;Clear Files in Personal Folder&quot; code.

We can see that the value here is **not** logfiles but our username+SQLFiles..
This is not what we want.. let&#39;s change this value to logfiles:

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/7/70d5098500082313158f4705ea33b44cbcc838f3.png&quot; width=&quot;464&quot; height=&quot;92&quot;&gt;


And done! Just hit &#39;Clear Files in Personal Folder&#39; and the challenge is solved..



### Bonus time 

Solving these tasks in javascript:

#### Stage 1

    javascript:void(document.write(&#39;&lt;form name=the_form action=movemoney.php method=post&gt;&lt;input type=hidden name=FROM value=GaryWilliamHunter&gt;&lt;input type=hidden name=TO value=dropCash&gt;&lt;input type=hidden name=AMOUNT value=10000000&gt; &lt;input type=submit value=&quot;move money&quot; &gt;&lt;/form&#39;))

#### Stage 2

    javascript:void(document.write(&#39;&lt;form action=cleardir.php method=post&gt;&lt;input type=hidden name=dir value=LogFiles&gt;&lt;input type=submit value=&quot;clear files&quot;&gt;&lt;/form&#39;))

# Conclusions
Another small fun challenge for testing out some methods.
We already learned these briefly in the past challenges.
This time we had to combine some of these to solve the challenge. Still not a problem.  
The next article of the series can be found [here](https://0x00sec.org/t/hts-org-r9-challenge/) once it&#39;s up!!
 
Stay tuned ;)</description>
