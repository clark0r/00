    <description>Hey just wondering what bookmarks you guys have on your browser that help you with your hacking, im still noob level and have been for several years, but i know a couple things. Im trying to build the best online resuource portal  i found a great collection at  https://github.com/kargisimos/offensive-bookmarks 

lots of stuff there in that html file but i just find it seems incomplete.

theres also https://github.com/vitalysim/Awesome-Hacking-Resources wich doesn&#39;t a html file for bookmarks but plenty of good links and resources to study up on.


but yeh just wondering what kind of resources and sites are you guys goto?</description>
