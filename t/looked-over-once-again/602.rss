    <title>Looked over once again</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/looked-over-once-again/602</link>
    <description>Today I was introduced to the new IT guy at my job. He seemed ok, but he took the position I applied for a couple weeks ago. I work for a vehicle plant and you don&#39;t need to know much for the position. Hell, our last IT guy majored in film!  Besides venting I ask, what can I do to secure an entry level IT position?</description>

<p>I’ve been for my Security + exam, but most forums say its worthless unless you want to get into the DoD( which I don’t ).  I aspire to be a security engineer but I don’t have the experience. Where do I actually start to build a career. Like cert path with no experience…</p>
<p>Thanks for all the help guys. I know this may be out of place…</p>

            <p>Go get yourself some certs… all tech companies have boners for certs, and they’re stupid easy, at least the A+, Sec+, arguably Network+ are… they’re each about $300, but are half off if you use a *.edu email to register or something. GL!</p>

            <p>IT guys typically have the lowest level of skill. You want to seek something higher like sysadmin or network engineer.</p>
