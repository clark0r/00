    <title>Problems setting up a docker pentesting-lab</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/problems-setting-up-a-docker-pentesting-lab/22735</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,

I&#39;m not sure, if this is the right category, but I need help configuring my local lab with docker.

I pulled and ran both, the _kalilinux/kali-rolling_ and the _tleemcjr/metasploitable2_ repo. I also created a new virtual docker network to give them IP-addresses and keep them both separate from the outside world.

Yet if I want to to do a simple port scan with nmap (from the kali, of the metasploitable-machine) all I get &quot;_All 1000 scanned ports are closed_&quot;, which is clearly wrong as the metasploitable-machine should be as open as it can be. This also occours, if I keep away my custom network settings.

My guess is that some network configuration of the docker container is wrong, but I can&#39;t figure out which one.

Does anyone has a good tutorial or experience with his own virtual lab? Or an idea, what could be wrong?

Thank you guys in advance for your reply.</description>

            <p>I found the solution:</p>
<p>You need to start the services with the bash when you start the image. As explained in <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/tleemcjr/metasploitable2" rel="nofollow noopener">Docker Hub Page</a> auf the image.</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name container-name -it tleemcjr/metasploitable2:latest sh -c "/bin/services.sh &amp;&amp; bash"</code></pre>
