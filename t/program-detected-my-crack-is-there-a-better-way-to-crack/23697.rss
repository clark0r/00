    <title>Program detected my crack, is there a better way to crack?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/program-detected-my-crack-is-there-a-better-way-to-crack/23697</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to crack a trial version of a Windows program called [Hot Alarm Clock](https://hotalarmclock.com/download/). I disassembled it with IDA and patched it, but now when I start the program, it says &quot;File is corrupted! Hot Alarm Clock is infected by a Virus or cracked. Please install the program again.&quot; Is there a better way to do this?</description>
