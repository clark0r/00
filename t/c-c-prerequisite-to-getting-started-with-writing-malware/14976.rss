    <title>C/C++ prerequisite to getting started with writing malware</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/c-c-prerequisite-to-getting-started-with-writing-malware/14976</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m just getting started with malware analyst and the number one problem that I got is what and where to learn enough C/C++ to write these program. There is so much online materials for basic C/C++ but I can&#39;t find any source that teach more advance C/C++ for networking, system,... So do you know any good resource for these kind of stuff?

Thanks a lot</description>

            <p>Reading MSDN resources is a good place to start and looking at leaks from major malware families. Carbanak is an interested family to look into. Other than that its gonna take a lot of trial and error.</p>
