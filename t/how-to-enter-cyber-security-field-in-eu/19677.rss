    <title>How to enter cyber security field in EU?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/how-to-enter-cyber-security-field-in-eu/19677</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a experienced programmer and Web developer with formal education in embedded/electronics development.

I&#39;m thinking to make my next career move into some cybersec position and the field of pentesting seems very interesting.

What are my options to do the transition? What are some of the best online resources and classes to use, especially for EU Market? I looked at stuff like pentester academy, but I&#39;m not sure those would qualify for a job position. Is pentesting even exciting at all? Or its just running automated tools, and writing reports?

Eventually, I would like to get hired with by some defence contractor or something, as it seems they get the most interesting work done.

Any advice is greatly appreciated
