    <title>Well this is interesting</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/well-this-is-interesting/238</link>
    <description>On null byte one person talked about how the community is dying so I briefly said that while a lot of people moved to 0x00sec, the community on nb will still be active. I also mentioned OTW&#39;s new site which is probably a no-no now that I think about it.

The WHT mods pounced upon my poor post and removed it. Rip.</description>

Well, they move in mysterious ways I suppose. I was wondering though, what happens if I were to take one of my posts from NB and post it here verbatim? It’s all my own words and images… out of curiosity</p>

            <p>Some of OTW’s better posts, as well as many of the tutorials of members who although made a great tutorial posted something on it that the mods disagreed with. Blatant censorship to be honest.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/cromical">@Cromical</a> What got deleted exactly? <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/defalt">@Defalt</a> I see of course that people at WHT are just people with lives and livelihoods. Far be it from me to judge them … I’m just a grumpy bastard today, but bear no ill will. I hope that NB gets back on it’s feet again, and I see that really they’re just trying to do that.</p>

            <p>True, although I’m extremely sad. I can’t help but think of all the useful information on NB that could have helped so-so many people, but got deleted during OTW’s leave. Which is why I’m considering documenting and archiving all seemingly important and currently existent NB how-to’s and posts. I think people should have the right to see that information without restrictions.</p>

            <p>I hate to play devils advocate, but you can’t blame WHT for what they’ve done. They’re a company. There are people who depend on WHT to put food on the table. In the end, they’re doing what’s best for them.</p>
<p>Also, WHT pissed off a community of hackers, do you think they’re going to play nice?</p>

            <p>I would respect WHT/NB a lot more if they said, “Hey look, we’d rather you didn’t advertise other rival sites here, because we like our profits around here, see?”… At least then there’s communication. The post I had deleted had no malicious intent against WHT or NB, and if someone had said, hey please don’t write that, I may well have just not cared too much. The stealthy deletions create a really weird atmosphere where you might start to wonder, will I bother posting my opinions here anymore, where I might get censored, or will I just go elsewhere? Plus nobody likes the feeling of being watched either.</p>

            <p>The culture of WHT and subsequently NB is incredibly black and white toward generating a profit. WHT is a company, and they will do whatever they can in order to generate those profits. If that includes censorship and aggressive actions toward users then they will do that.</p>
<p>0x00sec is different because our motivations and work is all done around and for the community, rather than to make a profit. We will never censor a post, unless it contains something sexually explicit, personally identifiable information etc. We don’t delete posts because they might make us look bad; we agree than information should be free, and if that means somebody has created a badass rival site, then so be it.</p>

            <p>On null byte one person talked about how the community is dying so I briefly said that while a lot of people moved to 0x00sec, the community on nb will still be active. I also mentioned OTW’s new site which is probably a no-no now that I think about it.</p>
