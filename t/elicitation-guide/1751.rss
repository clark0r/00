    <title>Elicitation Guide?</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/elicitation-guide/1751</link>
    <description>Im an extremely Extroverted Person.   I love people, to the point i have full blown conversations with people inside a store, or gas station, as if we have been friends for years.  I dont really have that much knowledge base about exploits, or full on pentesting..YET!

I am still learning, but i know that in a lot of &quot;hypothetical Situations&quot; i can rely on my social skills heavily to do a lot of the work.   One of my white hat friends is always amazed at how much work load i could possibly save just by being a people person. 

 I have read hundreds of books, watched plenty of lectures, and practiced many techniques revolving around reading peoples body language, judging tone of voice to feelings, and using my ability to gain someones trust in 5 minutes or less.  I recently have found myself going into hotels, businesses, etc..etc.. to see how long i can blend in before anyone notices.  You would be surprised how many people dont care to ask who this in a button up and tie, walking around with an iPad is.  

There is just, something so Clandestine about it, as if i was living in a spy film that drives me to do it.   I wont do anything crazy and go into government buildings, or do any damage, However it is amazing how fast you can sharpen your social skills by just pretending, Either in person, or over the phone.  


My tech skills are not up to par with most in this awesome community....but my social skills are definitely a strong suit worth sharing.   Its one of the few things i can try to contribute to the community for the time being.    

So my question is,  Would there be anyone interested in a guide to &quot;Pretending&quot; ?  

If so let me know below, and include certain topics, or situations you would like me to include.</description>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/bugsy">@Bugsy</a>, thanks for the shout out! It’s nice to see someone else taking interest in Social Engineering AND make posts about it.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I must say, I’m quite the opposite. I’m not an extremely introverted person (i.e social anxiety, etc…), but I wouldn’t strike a conversation with a random Joe on the street.</p>
<p>Like I previously mentioned in my posts, everybody has a somewhat different approach when interacting with a target or gathering information. For example, I, as an introverted indivual, would most likely try to gain information on my target by indirect contact, meaning I’d observe him/her from afar, try to understand his habits &amp; behaviours, slowly infiltrating into his life and if I had to directly contact him, I’d probably have some kind of script or a few bullent points to guide me through the conversation.</p>
<p>You however, being an extroverted person, would most likely gather “all” the data you need by simply directly interacting with said target without having to through all the trouble of passive data gathering (which is not to say it’s not important).</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a> This is a WONDERFUL book. Most of my articles are heavily inspired by it.  I believe he has written another book that fits into this subject, however I can’t recall the name…</p>

            <p>The thing that works for me on the phone, and might help you, is that you can hang up at any time. I can quit if it goes wrong. In person that can be much more difficult to eject.</p>

<p>Social engineering is IMHO still not recognised enough or taken seriously  as a threat.<br>

            <p>I agree! I’m the opposite though. It’s difficult for me to SE over the phone but in person it’s a lot easier. There honestly is something surreal about it all.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/bugsy">@Bugsy</a> I would absolutely love to see you do a guide and point out some helpful tips for us!!</p>

            <p>This would be really good. I have recently seen ‘Catch me if you can’, and that is a lovely portrayal of social engineering.</p>
<p>I can social engineer over the phone fairly well, although I struggle to fake my physical body language. It would be cool if you would discuss some exercises one could do in order to improve their social engineering stance? SE is so important for a successful pentest.</p>
<p>Looking forward to it.</p>

            <p>After Posting this i saw that <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/n3xus">@n3xUs</a> has already made a guide to this, So i will try and include some things that differ from his, or put my own take on it.  But if this is something you are really looking for i recommend his super in depth guide.</p>
<p>N3xUs Social Engineering Guide - <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/social-engineering-part-2-elicitation/420" class="inline-onebox">Social Engineering - Part 2 - Elicitation</a></p>

            <p>Im an extremely Extroverted Person.   I love people, to the point i have full blown conversations with people inside a store, or gas station, as if we have been friends for years.  I dont really have that much knowledge base about exploits, or full on pentesting…YET!</p>
<p>I am still learning, but i know that in a lot of “hypothetical Situations” i can rely on my social skills heavily to do a lot of the work.   One of my white hat friends is always amazed at how much work load i could possibly save just by being a people person.</p>
<p>I have read hundreds of books, watched plenty of lectures, and practiced many techniques revolving around reading peoples body language, judging tone of voice to feelings, and using my ability to gain someones trust in 5 minutes or less.  I recently have found myself going into hotels, businesses, etc…etc… to see how long i can blend in before anyone notices.  You would be surprised how many people dont care to ask who this in a button up and tie, walking around with an iPad is.</p>
<p>There is just, something so Clandestine about it, as if i was living in a spy film that drives me to do it.   I wont do anything crazy and go into government buildings, or do any damage, However it is amazing how fast you can sharpen your social skills by just pretending, Either in person, or over the phone.</p>
<p>My tech skills are not up to par with most in this awesome community…but my social skills are definitely a strong suit worth sharing.   Its one of the few things i can try to contribute to the community for the time being.</p>
<p>So my question is,  Would there be anyone interested in a guide to “Pretending” ?</p>
<p>If so let me know below, and include certain topics, or situations you would like me to include.</p>
