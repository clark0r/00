<p>IDENTIFYING YOUR BRAND</p>
<p>To setup ones brand, Identification of things you like, choices, and wishes is the most<br>
difficult part.<br>
As such there is no foolproof way to discover setup your brand.<br>
The following a the questions we have to ask our selves in the due process<br>
What is your qualification?<br>
What is your area of interest?<br>
What do you want to achieve?<br>
What is your passion?<br>
How are you currently perceived?<br>
How are you perceived in your personal and professional relationships?<br>
What is your industry/sector?<br>
What is the market and target audience for your brand?<br>
What is your niche?After the above do the following</p>
<ol>
<li>Write down five things that you like most;<br>
2 .Write down five points for which you are appreciated more often by the people<br>
around you.<br>
Try comparing all the above from 1 and 2 and find any that you need to improve<br>
while thinking about you and the peoples view point.<br>
Once you are done identifying your brand, now you need to −</li>
</ol>
<p>Set a goal.</p>
<p>Note down your mission, vision, and personal brand statement.<br>
Build a strategy that is small and in simple steps. Once you complete first only then<br>
move on to the second strategy and so on. A complicated strategy in the very first<br>
instance can discourage you, so avoid it, and choose a simple path).</p>
<p>How to Create Your Brand?</p>
<p>Thoughts and likeness, which will help you to personalize your brand vision. With the<br>
following steps, it will be easier for you to create your brand<br>
Step 1<br>
Note down your values − It could be anything that gives meaning to your life.<br>
Possibly, you are not aware of these values, but in most of your decisions, it plays a<br>
big role.<br>
For example, your value could be −<br>
Community (society)<br>
Work Intelligence (the work you can perform best)<br>
Hobbies (the work that more often you live to do)<br>
Ambition/Goal (the ultimate destination)<br>
However, this is not the conclusive list, it is just an example. If you correctly note<br>
down your values, it will definitely help you develop a successful personal branding<br>
strategy.</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
Prioritize your Values − After listing and categorizing your values, now you need to<br>
prioritize them. While prioritizing, take help of your interest, likeness, and even your<br>
passion. These will help you prioritize your values.<br>
Step 3<br>

not notice, but most of your behavior is guided by your trait. Following are the five<br>
most important personality traits −<br>

minded you are.<br>

people.<br>

considerate you are.<br>

feature is usually discouraged; so, it is good to cure/suppress this kind of<br>
trait/symptom.<br>

advantages. For example, good voice, eloquence, witty demeanor, etc.<br>

that might be potential hindrance in a career. For example, fear in public, not able to<br>
speak properly in front of people, etc.<br>

good. For example, opportunity of a job, opportunity to deal a project, etc…</p>

your threat, but of course, you can address and mitigate them. For example, sudden<br>
