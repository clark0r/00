    <title>Mr Robot - My First CTF</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/mr-robot-my-first-ctf/1991</link>
    <description>To the surprise of probably many, to this day I had never properly attempted a CTF in the red team sense of the word. I had dabbled with little Reverse Engineering challenges and Crackme&#39;s posted on the site. But I had never downloaded a VM with a vulnerable machine. 

I started my CTF adventure with this box. I struggled initially but @anon3236228 was there to help me through it. 

I would recommend this to any new-comers to CTF&#39;s, that might be uncertain about them. Give it a go! And let me know how it went!

            <p>I found the first flag and tried to find second for some time. <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/mr-robot-my-first-ctf/1991/2">spoiler</a></span> but then I got mad since I couldn’t find the second flag and closed it. I’m planning to try it again later.</p>
