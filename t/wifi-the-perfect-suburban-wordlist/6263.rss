    <title>[Wifi] The Perfect Suburban Wordlist</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/wifi-the-perfect-suburban-wordlist/6263</link>
    <description>Recently I moved into a new suburban neighborhood littered with default router access points. One day, I decided I wanted to test my luck and see what I could get by using a simple but very effective _Wordlist_

A few years ago I use to work as a cable installation technician. I&#39;ve noticed most technicians will ask the customer if they would like to change their default password for the router. Rather than awaiting for the customer’s timely response, a technician may  insist: _“We can always set the password to your phone number, and you can change it later if you’d like.”_ This is very convenient for the customer, and its likely they’ll never change it anyhow.


&gt; 
&gt; **Using crunch to create a simple wordlist:** you can generate a _phone number list_ for whatever area code the router happens to be located in. 

![crunch|690x182](upload://8XypWxSVxarg50BOhB5xfLQDrnJ.png)

&gt; _In layman&#39;s terms, The -t specifies a specific pattern. The % character specifies to use a number and  -s lets you choose where to begin. (If you&#39;d like to bypass the phone numbers starting in the 000&#39;s and 100&#39;s.)_

&gt; 
&gt; _Your generated wordlist will look something like this_

Not only is this is a great list to have for suburban environments, but it may be great for business AP&#39;s as well. I&#39;ve been told alot of businesses typically use their fax number for their AP. I&#39;ve come to find this is a very effective wordlist and I don&#39;t see it mentioned to much. 

**Find the area code you&#39;re working in and give it a go!**</description>
