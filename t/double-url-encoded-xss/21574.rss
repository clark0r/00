    <title>Double URL-encoded XSS</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/double-url-encoded-xss/21574</link>
    <description>Right after the quarantine ended I had a mini burn out for more than a month, where I didn’t even bother to try and hunt for bugs. After those one and a half months of trying to find my motivation again, I found a XSS that required a bit more thinking than the typical `javascript:alert(1)` cases.

Revisiting my old notes from a BB program, I observed an endpoint that I tried to exploit the last time, before I go through that burn out. Back then I wasn’t able to exploit it, so now I thought I’d give it a second chance. The endpoint was `https://example.com/dir/legacy-browser?redir=/`. There was a button, where you would get redirected to the endpoint the paramteter redir was pointing. Analyzing the source code, I could see that the website was redirecting the user this way:

![double_url_xss|484x22](upload://m8yTjozXcodwQrmbIrzY0PDD8nx.png) 

At first, I thought that this should be easy. I tried escaping the parenthesis by injecting `&#39;)` in the `redir` parameter. The result was that the illegal characters would be removed. Actually, if there was any illegal characters, the app would redirect you by default to `/`.

I tried to inject a null byte `%00`, just to see how the app would react. The app translated the null byte into `NULL`. So the payload `redir=/%00/` would get reflected into the source code as `javascript:redirect(&#39;/NULL/&#39;)`. I thought “great, the url encoded characters are getting decoded”. I clicked the button and… I got redirected to `/NULL/`. Also, any other illegal url encoded characters would be removed, just as I described previously.

So, apparently, the URL was getting decoded and sent to `javascript:redirect()`. But I wanted to inject some illegal characters to escape the parenthesis. After some thought, I came to the conclusion that in orded to send illegal characters to `javascript:redirect()`, those characters had to be URL-encoded, after they have been decoded from the URL bar. Hence the double URL encoding!

I sent the second payload `https://www.example.com/dir/legacy-browser?redir=/%2500/test`, where `%2500` is the double-URL-encoded null byte. The result was for `javascript:redirect(&#39;/%00/test&#39;)` to get reflected. After hitting the button, I got redirected to `https://example.com/`, meaning that the null byte in `javascript:redirect()` was actually getting decoded. So I could actually send working double URL encoded payloads.

Having this in my mind, I crafted a payload for this endpoint (and by crafting, I mean copying and pasting the XSS payload from [brutelogic](https://twitter.com/brutelogic) in [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XSS%20Injection) and adding a `&#39;)` in front). I double URL-encoded it and injected it into the parameter. And after hitting the button, the XSS was getting triggered, right before the user got redirected to `/`.

Final exploit: `https://example.com/enpoint?redir=/%2527)%253B%2520alert(document.cookies)%253B%252F%252F`
