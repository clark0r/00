    <title>RATs question. Long break</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/rats-question-long-break/11084</link>
    <description>Hey, i&#39;m new to this forum. I used to be into this stuff few years ago, when i was younger, around 15. I&#39;ve stopped after having some problems.
I was looking for some RATs (NjRAT is what i used mainly) but nowadays you can&#39;t trust nowhere. I found NjRAT and LimeRAT on Github. I know Github, obviously, but is it safe ? could be any backdoor ? any site/safe clean download anywhere you guys would know about ?
I used to be on another Hackers forum back in the day, small family. Great times, but they closed up, unfortunately.. these questions were no problem there, so i apologise if my question is against the rules or anything. I saw people talking about RATs on some topics so i figured it&#39;ll be no problem to ask. if it is, again, i aplogise. Please let me know.
Thanks.</description>
