    <description>Hi, 0x00sec.

Long time no see :slight_smile:

I got a new hobby - electronics. And I would like to recommend a book that helped me a lot with it. The book is &quot;Make: Electronics&quot; by Charles Platt. Best thing about it is that you can order a book with all necessary components (a.k.a starter kit). Also it&#39;s translated in many languages, I personally read it in Russian.

I had no experience in soldering before. A week after I started to read this book I soldered my first circuit:

[http://eax.me/files/2016/11/soldering.jpg](http://eax.me/files/2016/11/soldering.jpg)

(Please note that there is no soldering iron in a starter kit, you should order it separately). 

Long story short - it&#39;s one of the best books I&#39;ve ever read and I heartily recommend it.

Next step - AVR/Arduino and PIC microcontrollers.</description>

            <p>Ah, the good old oscillator! A very simple circuit but yet it is used almost everywhere.</p>
<p>I’ll check out your other circuits later. And don’t worry about the language, I’ve seen so many circuits I can recognize the common ones by schematics alone!</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/ioth1nkn0t">@IoTh1nkN0t</a>  I know a guy who worked with low voltage and current. One day his circuit exploded into his face and he almost lost his eyes. You also can easily get injured by a micro drill if you make a home brew PCB or even a long wire you are holding in some proximity of your face. I personally always use protective glasses.</p>

<p>A multivibrator is an electronic circuit used to implement a variety of simple two-state devices such as relaxation oscillators, timers and flip-flops. It consists of two amplifying devices (transistors, vacuum tubes or other devices) cross-coupled by resistors or capacitors.[failed verification]  The first multivibrator circuit, the astable multivibrator oscillator, was invented by Henri Abraham and Eugene Bloch during World War I.  They called their circuit a "multivibrator" beca The three type...</p>

            <p>Using low safety voltage (the 12V you are referring to) should protect you from electrocution, but making a short circuit could blow your power supply up. And that could blow your face off.</p>
<p>And that is why you always use fuses &amp; C.C. protected bench power supplies kids!</p>

            <p>If you just use electronics powered by 12V 1A there is not that much that can go wrong.<br>
So unless you build your own Rectifier, there shouldn’t be any really big dangers (Correct me if I’m wrong though).</p>

            <p>I can confirm, “Make: electronics” is a great book for starters and I also read it sometimes to freshen up on some knowledge.</p>
<p>But for starters: beware of the risks of electronics before attempting anything fancy. I’ll write an article on this, but it’s covered a little bit in the book as well. (Yea I stress safety a lot, but it happens too many times people get into HV experiments without knowing what they’re doing and end up losing a limb in the process <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:">)</p>
<p>BTW, what circuit did you put together <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/afiskon">@afiskon</a>?</p>
