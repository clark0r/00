    <title>About the outage</title>
    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/about-the-outage/161</link>
    <description>At 3:30am BST. I recieved an email telling me that the server was out of disk space. I caught it 3 hours later and implemented a temporary fix. 

This community has been expanding so rapidly over the last few days that we&#39;ve ran out of disk space, and need to begin expanding server resources. This is on one hand a minor inconvience, but on another hand a massive positive. It shows our growth as a community. 

To offset the costs we will be soon experiencing, we will be launching a donations platform (probably bitcoin &amp; paypal). 

Thank you for your patience!

            <p>I agree, this would make us an actual company.<br>
That would require degrees and certificates.<br>
And more importantly, real identities.</p>

            <p>I understand that mate, I only put it up as a last scenario plan we should at least consider. I mean I really don’t think we’ll be thinking about whether knowledge or free or not (although I think it should be), when the site’s struggling. I really don’t want that to ever happen, but my point of view is that in case the worst should happen we should start being a bit more accepting about methods we may think wrong or methods other sites use.</p>

            <p>I would advice against doing pentests. We are after all a community, not a registered infosec research center. Companies have no way of checking if we are legitimate and thus they won’t trust us. And honestly, I can’t blame them. Not to mention all the juridical trouble to deal with.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people trying to give us a bad name could lead us all into a trap that way.</p>
<p>However, pentesters could conduct pentests on their own and donate their profits to 0x00sec.</p>

            <p>Wow that’s awesome! I really like the idea of doing something to support the site, rather than just going “GIVE US MONEY PLZ”. I had an idea to do security scans and security assements for companies/people. 0x00sec could become a Pentesting company. We don’t exactly have a shortage of talented people around here!</p>

            <p>As some of you already know, I will be building a small electronics lab later this year, which will allow me to build my designs like EMP’s and spy gadgets. I might auction them on ebay and the money can go to 0x00sec! Though I think it would be illegal to put stuff like that on ebay…</p>

            <p>Ye ads are pretty pointless they are always annoying, also I feel like an adblocker is pretty much a basic part of security these days.</p>
<p>I think the best ways to go are donations especially if you added something like bitcoin; that will probably work even while the site is small (hopefully won’t be too long).<br>
Another way to go is for merch like hoddies, t-shirts, stickers just stuff like that, though like <a class="mention" href="https://0x00sec.org/u/pry0cc">@pry0cc</a> said isn’t really vialbe till theres more users.</p>

<p>I was thinking stickers and hoodies would be cool. Of course I want to wait until the site is a bit larger, maybe 500 users? But I think 0x00sec stickers would be cool as.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion, but I want this site adfree.<br>
For now I don’t mind paying it. However if the site grows too big, then RAM and CPU might become a problem. Upgrading that is a lot more expensive. I shall consider the donations.</p>

            <p>We have another option too, it doesn’t seem a bit too far out to have courses about hacking set up on someplace like Udemy for example, where people could pay to see top line hacking courses made by 0x00sec Mods, Admins, Founders, and members even. And all the profit would go into sustaining the site itself. I don’t 100% agree with this idea, but if times got tough we should at least try to keep it in mind as a possible option.</p>

            <p>I really hate ads. I feel a little like ads will be a dying out form of monitization due to the overwhelming use of adblockers. One of the things that I feel that makes this site different to Nullbyte is how much cleaner it is, and how it doesn’t shove ads in your face.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could look at it on a smaller scale. We should have further discussion for the future.</p>

            <p>You guys could look at ads. We wouldn’t mind seeing one or two, as long as it keeps the site afloat.</p>

            <p>At 3:30am BST. I recieved an email telling me that the server was out of disk space. I caught it 3 hours later and implemented a temporary fix.</p>
<p>This community has been expanding so rapidly over the last few days that we’ve ran out of disk space, and need to begin expanding server resources. This is on one hand a minor inconvience, but on another hand a massive positive. It shows our growth as a community.</p>
<p>To offset the costs we will be soon experiencing, we will be launching a donations platform (probably bitcoin &amp; paypal).</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience!<br>
