    <link>https://0x00sec.org/t/wich-vpn-is-the-most-secure-and-how-to-pay-it/7814</link>
    <description>Hello, im a newbie in &quot;the hacking world&quot;, never got the time to get in, and as i go reading, more and more questions come to my mind, one of those are the one i have written in the title:
which vpn is the most secure and offers more anonymity?
i did a couple of searchs and i think nordvpn is one of the most secure, does anybody has an opinion?

and the other one: which payment method is the most anonymous?
can someone give me advice? thank you!</description>

            <p>Mh, back then when I started to learn about this stuff I enjoyed this video here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P4BjjXghQ">VPN - Virtual Private Networking</a></p>

<p>It explains VPNs for beginners (really basic) and teaches you some basics about the Internet. Although, it isn’t about anonymity.<br>
Could be something you are looking for. But in the end, it all comes down to reading good written articles and Wikipedia for hours and look up unknown terms.</p>

            <p>Well, anonymity on the Internet is a way more complex topic as you probably aware of. It’s not just buying a VPN with Bitcoin or something. If you want to learn more about it I would recommend you the Whonix docs (Whonix is a operation system designed for Tor):<br>
<strong>[Non technical things]</strong> --&gt;</p>

<p><strong>[More technical stuff you could start with]</strong> --&gt;</p>

<p>For me it seems like you don’t have so much knowledge about computer security. So make yourself a tea, lean back and prepare for a hell lot of reading  <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Trust me its worth it.</p>
<p>Oh and don’t forget to take a look at all the other stuff in the Whonix docs. They are pretty well written!</p>
