            <p>I know that doesn’t exist a quick way to learn a programming language, so that’s why it is in a quote.<br>
The motive why I opened this topic is to ask where to learn Pascal programming language. The Internet is an ocean of good n’ shit contents, and I don’t know a trustworthy font of the subject that I never stand up to until now.</p>
<p>I want to slowly dive into the algorithm with “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191211063215/http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/AD.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Algorithms and Data Structures</a>,” and does anyone knows if I need to learn Pascal first from external content to get that?</p>

            <p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>I am actually try to reverse a Ninebot G30, but i am not very lucky with it, and theres some sort of strange behavior the ESC of the scooter shows: The firmware sets the read out protection by itself. I tried to disable that to set command to jump over the instruction, but this does not work. I have readed that:<a href="https://lujji.github.io/blog/reverse-engineering-stlink-firmware-part2/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://lujji.github.io/blog/reverse-engineering-stlink-firmware-part2/</a></p>
<p>And found the adresses for the lockbits in my firmware, but every attempt to change the program so it will jump over the instruction does not work. Is there a way to patch a binary directly in IDA?</p>
<p>Here I have a screenshot from IDA, I think the rad framed function part sets the lockbits.<br>

<h1><a name="p-33073-introduction-to-quantum-computing-part-2-2" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-introduction-to-quantum-computing-part-2-2"></a>Introduction to Quantum Computing :: Part <span class="hashtag-raw">#2</span></h1>
<p>Hello again, I’m back with another guide. Last chapter we discussed some basic principles of Quantum physics, I really encourage you to read the <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/introduction-to-quantum-computing-part-1/7996/4" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">first chapter</a> before diving into this one. This chapter will cover the bases of quantum computing, I recommend being familiar with unitary matrices, vectors, basic linear algebra and basic computer logic. Also, my guide will be hosted on GitHub, I will use Jupyter notebook to show some mathematical notation, so you can clone the repository and read from there, I think it’s more comfy.</p>
<p>So now, in this tutorial we are going to review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.1. Basic Math Concepts and Some Feedback Links</p>
<p>2.2. A Brief History of Quantum Computing</p>
<p>2.3. The Qubit</p>
<p>2.2. Getting the Record Straight</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="p-33073-basic-math-concepts-3" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-basic-math-concepts-3"></a>Basic Math Concepts</h2>
<p>So, math. It’s maybe the most important part of quantum computing. We are gonna see absolute values and complex number. Remember this is gonna be a basic overview of this, just for you to remember some basic conceps we dont use in day-to-day life.</p>
<h3><a name="p-33073-complex-numbers-4" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-complex-numbers-4"></a>Complex numbers</h3>
<p>In day-to-day life we use real numbers, numbers on a one-dimensional matter if you will, you can imagine them as numbers on a two directional line, where 0 is the center of this line, left are negative numbers and right are positive numbers. Like this:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/bd03e0b45b4cc921d0be5d41268c75ac24cfc35f.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/qY6y62VFWYkwj8AYyQh3RCIsrxl.png?dl=1" title="alt-text" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/bd03e0b45b4cc921d0be5d41268c75ac24cfc35f.png" alt="alt-text" width="513" height="261"></a></div><p></p>
<p>When you are at the center of this imaginary number line (meaning your position is zero) and then you add five, you are gonna be at position 5. This is the basics of group theory. We can interpret this field as an additive field, in which we can add to our original position (which is zero), and we are going to move to another position in our number line, streeching it (see reference links for a visual interpretetion). But, this is only in a two-dimensional matter. Are there any numbers in a three-dimensional matter?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, they are called imaginary numbers. You can imagine this numbers as numbers in another dimension, we don’t only have 1 or -1. We have 1i 2i etc… This numbers are useful enough to show quantum states as we are gonna do.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/1/1655a2f901956acf2ddd051495f052551ccbf3a1.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/3bzYKUkh1fSO3ZgR3xVTc8Hz7qx.png?dl=1" title="alt-text" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/1/1655a2f901956acf2ddd051495f052551ccbf3a1.png" alt="alt-text" width="220" height="237"></a></div><p></p>
<p>In here our A or X axis are real numbers and the B or Y axis are imaginary numbers. So instead of representing this as a normal equation, we are going to add a i at the end of out b or i axis. Because imaginary numbers are represented by an i, so our equation is:</p>
<p>Real:a+b</p>
<p>Complex:a+bi</p>
<h3><a name="p-33073-basic-matrices-5" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-basic-matrices-5"></a>Basic Matrices</h3>
<p>In computer science we use matrices for representing arrays, but in physics they are for representing vectors. Also, we are gonna see them alot of times, so try your best to read the feedback links. Here is a matrix example:</p>
<p>α=[0110]</p>
<h2><a name="p-33073-a-brief-history-of-quantum-computing-6" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-a-brief-history-of-quantum-computing-6"></a>A Brief History of Quantum Computing</h2>
<p>I gave you a brief history of quantum physics, now I’m gonna give lecture you about quantum computing history.</p>
<h4><a name="p-33073-h-1965-7" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-h-1965-7"></a>1965</h4>
<p>Richard Feynman developed quantum electrodynamics. Which is the way electrons interact with each other trough photons.</p>
<h4><a name="p-33073-h-1980-8" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-h-1980-8"></a>1980</h4>
<p>Feynman and others started to investigate on conventional information, and the computation of quantum states with binary data.</p>
<h4><a name="p-33073-h-1985-9" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-h-1985-9"></a>1985</h4>
<p>David Deutsch, described the ‘Univeral Quantum Computer’ on a theorical paper. In this paper he proved that a two-state system could be use to simulate a quantum system. The operations of this computer were called Quantum Gates.</p>
<h4><a name="p-33073-h-1994-10" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-h-1994-10"></a>1994</h4>
<p>Peter Shor proposed a method of using entangled qubits for finding the prime factor of integer. This is known as the Shor’s Algorithm. This algorithm whill surpass the efficency of any known computer when executed on a quantum computing.</p>
<h4><a name="p-33073-present-day-11" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-present-day-11"></a>Present day</h4>
<p>Quantum Computing is a big field now at days. New quantum gates come around every now and then.</p>
<h2><a name="p-33073-the-qubit-12" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-the-qubit-12"></a>The Qubit</h2>
<p>Finally we are actually gonna learn quantum computing. Okey, so what is a Qubit. Remember last post? When I talked about some crazy cat and the Copenhagen interpretation? Well, in normal computing, computers can have a bit. Meaning they can only be a zero and a one, our bit is going to be represented by alpha:</p>
<p>α=[01]</p>
<p>In a physical manner, a bit is represented by an electrical current. 0 is no current and 1 is current. This controls the motherboard of your computer with the help of chemical transistors.</p>
<p>Well, in quantum computing our bit can be a 0 and a 1 at the same time. Just like in the copenhagen interpretetion, quantum computing takes advantage of super position, so our bit is in both states at the same time. Now let’s visualize this as alpha and let’s introduce another qubit, beta:</p>
<p>α=[01]β=[10]</p>
<p>Now, our qubit is 0 and a 1 at the same time. How do we represent the possibility of this? This can be represented in the following way:</p>
<p>|ψ⟩=|α⟩+|β⟩</p>
<p>So we have psi equal alpha plus beta. Remember that psi is the way to represent the wave function of a quantum system. All the posiblities on a quantum system. And does weird parentesis are called the bra-ket notation. This notation is used to represent a quantum state. Alpha and beta are complex numbers that obey:</p>
<p>|α|2+|β|2=1</p>
<p>At the begining, our ground qubit will always be zero. Why? normally quantum computers use a type of hardware qubit named a superconducting transmon qubit, which is made of superconducting materials like aluminum or nobium. For this to behave as our abstract notion of the qubit it needs to be cooled at super frosty temperatures. It takes some days to reach perfect equilibrium, and when is does our “ground qubit” will be zero.</p>
<p>Well, our qubit needs to be other things too, not only a 0. So how do we manage our qubit. There are certain ways of doing these. In normal computers you use logic gates, gates like AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NOR etc. In the quantum world we use quantum gates (we will see them with more detail on the next chapter). For now we are going to learn one. Typical gates are represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix.</p>
<p>We are going to talk about the bit-flip gate which is denoted by X.</p>
<p>|0⟩→X|0⟩=|1⟩</p>
<p>It simply flips the bit. Meaning, zero to one and vice versa. This has a matrix representation of it:</p>
<p>X=(0110)</p>
<p>This is it for now. On the next chapter there is gonna be hard math so I recommend getting familiar with linear algebra again.</p>
<h2><a name="p-33073-getting-the-record-straight-13" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-getting-the-record-straight-13"></a>Getting the Record Straight</h2>
<p>Quantum computing has been in everyones mind. It has been in on news report, movies ans series. Since the idea of thinking in to things at the same time it’s difficult for everyone, quantum computing has been misunderstude and by this it was plagued by myths and speculations. I will try to get the record straight with this myths and facts.</p>
<h2><a name="p-33073-h-1-quantum-computers-can-get-all-posibilities-at-once-14" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-h-1-quantum-computers-can-get-all-posibilities-at-once-14"></a>1. Quantum computers can get all posibilities at once</h2>
<p>This is a myth. There are several quantum algorithms out there, each one target different fields, but none of them check “all posibilities” at once. This myth comes from the RSA algorithm breaking. The Shor Algorithm doesnt go over all primes at the same time, this algorithm just finds a quantum way or trick for getting the prime.</p>
<h2><a name="p-33073-h-2-d-wave-is-the-first-quantum-computer-15" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-h-2-d-wave-is-the-first-quantum-computer-15"></a>2. D-Wave is the first quantum computer</h2>
<p>Again, not at all. D-Wave is a quantum annealer. It’s great for optimizing solutions to problems by quickly searching over a space and finding a minimum (or “solution”) by running adiabatic quantum algorithms. However, quantum annealing will never be able to run Shor’s algorithm, which breaks common forms of modern cryptography, like RSA and ECC.</p>
<h2><a name="p-33073-conclusion-16" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-33073-conclusion-16"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading and waiting for this little guide. If you have any question go ahead and talk to me, no problem. In the next chapter we will use a quantum computer in the cloud, trust me, it’s gonna be fun. This is it for now, have fun and never stop searching.</p>

I enjoy it, but what I’m really into is theoretical computer science, and also programming. For the past 2 months I’ve been studying quantum computing, so why not teach it. This series will cover basic concepts of quantum physics and some theoretical math.</p>
<p>This post will cover:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>What is Quantum Physics</li>
<li>History of Quantum Physics</li>
<li>Schrödinger’s cat</li>
<li>The Wave Function</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have any doubt don’t be afraid of commenting this post and asking.</p>
<p>So let’s start…</p>
<h2><a name="p-27612-what-is-quantum-physics-2" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-27612-what-is-quantum-physics-2"></a>What is Quantum Physics</h2>
<p>Since the birth of men we have been trying to uncover the truths of the universe. Plato, Aristoteles where in a way, the founders of physics and all sciences. They use to ask questions and tried to get answers, even Aristoteles tried to tackle the question of gravity (he was wrong lel), but at least he tried. Many man came across some questions and tackled them, persons like Newton, Galileo, Copernicus were the founders of classical mechanics, but later there was another questions, what is matter made of? And we came with the concept of atoms, a simple model at first, then it got more complex.</p>
<p>Atoms are a normal part of our daily life, they are everywhere because you are made of them, and not only you, but every object around you. When scientists started to try and uncover the secrets of these weird little dots that were floating around in space they found very weird stuff. This evolved into the field of quantum mechanics that we know today. (more about this in the history part).</p>
<p>Quantum physics study all the things we cannot simply see and measure, like particles and atoms. The smallest things in the universe are being studied in this field. Quantum concepts are hard to understand at first, but if you really like this let me tell you that is a beautiful challenging new world and you are going to have a lot of fun.</p>
<h2><a name="p-27612-history-of-quantum-physics-3" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-27612-history-of-quantum-physics-3"></a>History of Quantum Physics</h2>
<p>The history of Quantum physics is mixed up with the history of chemistry. It started with the cathode-ray tube, then the Black Body radiation problem by Kirchhoff, consequently the Photoelectric effect and finally we have Max Planck.</p>
<p>In the 1900 Max Planck (famous for the Planck’s constant) presented a theory where he assumed that energy existed as individual units, like little boxes, instead of a constant electromagnetic wave. He called this little boxes “<strong>quantas</strong>”, this name was obviously very influential.</p>
<p>Other scientists came along, and used this theory to explain some of their theories.The most influential scientist (and famous) to use it, Albert Einstein, quoted this theory on his tackle on the Photoelectric effect problem.</p>
<p>Several theories came out, about the same time, one of the most important was by Louis de Broglie in 1924. He created the theory of wave-particle duality. Then in 1927 one of the most influential physicist on this field, Werner Heisenberg (yes, Walter White name is inspired by this guy) published <strong>The Uncertainty Principle</strong>, where he states a very famous quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The more precisely the position is determined, the less precisely the momentum is known in this instant, and vice versa.”<br>
–<strong>Heisenberg, uncertainty paper, 1927</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He predicted that the more you know about something, the less you know about another thing.</p>
<p>Finally (for now) but not less important, Bohr came up with the Copenhagen interpretation. According to Bohr’s theory, a particle, until it’s measured, is in every possible state at the same time, by measuring the system we make it collapse and forces it to only show one possibility. This is better known as <strong>superposition</strong>.</p>
<h2><a name="p-27612-schrdingers-cat-4" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-27612-schrdingers-cat-4"></a>Schrödinger’s Cat</h2>
<p>In 1935 a Austrian physicist named Erwin Schrödinger came up with a visualization of the Copenhagen interpretation in everyday objects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He called everyone to imagine a cat, poison, a geiger detector, radioactive material and a hammer into a closed box. The radioactive material so small that it only had a 50/50 shot of being detected over the course of an hour. If the geiger counter detected radiation, the hammer would smash the poison, killing the cat. Until someone opened the container and observed the system, it was impossible to predict if the cat’s outcome. Thus, until the system collapsed into one configuration, the cat would exist in some superposition zombie state of being both alive and dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how do we call all of this possibilities? Well Schrödinger came up with something called <strong>the wave function</strong>.</p>
<h2><a name="p-27612-the-wave-function-5" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-27612-the-wave-function-5"></a>The wave function</h2>
<p>The wave function is a mathematical way to describe all the quantum states (possibilities) of a quantum system, and is represented by the Greek letter psi.<br>
<img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/7/798e990866f9747e66f9593ad0a45ff555456547.jpg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="hllhS6svoq56TpDcMC16fC7XRAz" width="608" height="211"><br>
The square root can be discarded by using <strong>the Born’s rule</strong> that yields the possibility by raising to the power of two.</p>
<h2><a name="p-27612-conclusion-6" class="anchor" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk#p-27612-conclusion-6"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Quantum computing it’s not an easy field, it requires a lot of study and a lot of asking. If you have any question or correction go ahead and I’ll give it a shot. This are only the basics, on the next chapter we are going to start the main topic, quantum computing. There’s gonna be more math, so I recommend being familiar with vectors and some basic algebra.</p>

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Seems like a great place you all have going on here, so, thanks in advance for the warm reception ! <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
As there isn’t a Windows category that I could see, I have left this uncategorized, and coincidentally , the discussion i’d like to have is in fact about Windows.</p>
<p>Me: I wanted to get into infosec/hacking, and read everywhere I needed to learn Linux. So I did. I got a Linux system going and haven’t looked back.</p>
<p>Problem: I don’t know hardly anything about Windows. It seems the general consensus is that everybody has a solid grasp on Windows, there is an assumption that people grew up from Windows and graduated to Linux. Is there room in the space for a Windows Primer ? I think there is and would love to write one, once I’m done learning the lot!</p>
<p>I guess there is short, succinct guides and write ups on all sorts of Linux stuff, but short of reading a Microsoft exam study guide, It feels Windows stuff is harder to get up to speed with, what’s y’all recommendations on being as 1337 (jokes y’all) on Windows as I am Linux ? Anybody else get where I’m coming from here ?</p>
<p>Similarities and differences between the two…?<br>
Windows equivalent command to Linux ones ?<br>
Essentially Windows tools, like Net command etc etc<br>
AD primer ?<br>
Permissions 101 ?<br>
What you need to know what could be put on the back burner for now ?<br>
SysInternal suite, whats that all about etc etc ?</p>
<p>See where im going with this ?<br>
I am tired, and had a big old day so please go easy.</p>
<p>-Cheers<br>
LB</p>

          <title>How to perform action upon connection to netcat listener?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[HiM]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Uncategorized</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The subject pretty much says it all. I’m searching for a method to perform some actions on my linux machine upon connection to a netcat listener, such as sending an e-mail/sms notification.</p>
<p>The best I’ve been able to come up with would be setup some pipes as the input/output to the listener, and have a shell script running which monitors those pipes, but I was hoping the linux guru’s here might have something a bit more elegant.</p>

            <p>have been looking for Bind shell written in python and i found 2 scripts that look fine and the problem is that i dont know where to put my IP in both scripts in order to listen and get a connection…<br>
console.py is the attacker (the question is where to put my IP)<br>
server.py is the victim (the question is where to put my IP)</p>
<p>console.py --&gt;<br>
