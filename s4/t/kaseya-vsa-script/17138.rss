    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/kaseya-vsa-script/17138</link>
    <description>I have a feeling this is the wrong cat, but i am using kaseya vsa and i am a newbie i have been trying to wrtie the same registry script for a day now... If anyone has scripting ps knowledge and can help me out... i would beyond appreciate it so much! 

reg delete  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\default\Settings\AllowSignInOptions /v 0

this is a basic cmd command to switch the win10 machine to not basically work with a microsoft account local only. But........... for the love of god it will not work correctly when inserting into kaseya......
