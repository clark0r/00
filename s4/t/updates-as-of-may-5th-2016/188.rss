    <title>Updates as of May 5th, 2016</title>

    <description>Hello 0x00sec community!!!

@oaktree here. @pry0cc and I have recently decided to move the forum to [0x00sec.org](https://0x00sec.org/) rather than [discourse.0x00sec.org](https://0x00sec.org/). Popular sentiment is that the forum is better than the Github PR idea, and us creators agree!!! So, as of now, reset that bookmark!

A few things:

* All posts will be on the forum. It&#39;s easier for everyone -- faster, too.
* The blog will be subordinated. You won&#39;t run into it unless you&#39;re looking. Whether we will keep it is undecided. It _currently_ exists at [blog.0x00sec.org](http://blog.0x00sec.org/).
* The few posts that once were on the blog will be migrated over here shortly.
* The [Community Code](https://github.com/0x00sec/Community-Code) repository on our Github is currently deprecated.
* A [How-to](https://0x00sec.org/c/how-to) category is in place for any tutorials you may want to contribute. **How-to is NOT for questions.** Questions go in [Hacking](https://0x00sec.org/c/hacking) or [Computer Science](https://0x00sec.org/c/computer-science), or the appropriate section.
* When you submit anything to 0x00sec, please include relevant tags. This&#39;ll make it easier to find things down the road.

Today marks two weeks of development. Look how far we&#39;ve come: fifty-two users and counting, lots and lots of posts, over 10 GIGABYTES worth of data created by us!

And don&#39;t forget to come to the ##0x00sec IRC on freenode!</description>

            <p>It’s awesome to see more and more people on! I bet that in no less than 3 months this place will have even more people than NullByte, when you get that many awesome people together, it usually turns out great <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
