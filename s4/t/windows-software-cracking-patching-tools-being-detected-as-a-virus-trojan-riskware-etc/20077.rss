I have been doing some Reverse engineering lately, specifically on cracking / patching tools that cracks software license. To give you a general picture, patching softwares come in three shapes as far as I know:

* Case 0: A cracking/patching tool that only breaks the license of the software, It isn&#39;t encoded and doesn&#39;t have any suspicious activity, although  this is very rare.
* Case 1: A good majority of cracking tools are only packed by popular packers like UPX and does a dropper-like behavior by embedding the real binary and decoding it and loading/executing it on the runtime as a sub-process as a mean to hide the patching mechanism.

* Case 2: Some patching tools do in fact have viruses  (Cryptocurrency bots, ransomware , info-stealer and what not ) embedded  in the binary and drops the malware, which is in fact malicious in this case. This is Case 1/2 combined a with a virus. It&#39;s good to know that many developers/RE engineers that sell their keygen/patching tools for malicious actors, so they&#39;d embed a trojan into it. This has been the case for a very long while. 

Interesting facts: 
* An interesting thing that Case 0 / Case 1 &quot;malwares&quot; can pass through AVs by only changing the `icon` or a single `hex` value, which changes the the signature entirely.
* It can be hard to hide the malicious activity of Case 2 malwares as they are truly malicious and do quite a lot of things that can be observed through the network and the behavior of said malware.
* most of case 0/1 &quot;malware&quot; are marked as &quot;Win32/Keygen&quot;, &quot;riskware&quot;, &quot;patcher&quot;, &quot;highConfidence&quot;, &quot;injector&quot; and what not.

You can take a look at this one I recently reverse engineered (a cracking tool for a download manager), which I can guarantee that it doesn&#39;t have any malicious activity, it&#39;s a case 1 Patcher.


This is before changing the icon of the file (31/70) score :

Here&#39;s the same file, but with the icon removed (13/70) :

I&#39;m truly starting to wonder if AV companies flag patching/cracking software as malicious just for the sole purpose of protecting  other-companies-software?</description>
