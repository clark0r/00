    <description>Hey 0x00sec people! Not long ago, I said I would put up some source code for Dijkstra&#39;s Algorithm. Today, I&#39;ll be showing you just _one_ way to do it. We&#39;ll be utilizing an **Adjacency Matrix**, which is simply a 2D Array. _As we progress, each implementation will be more efficient than the last._

# Representation of A Graph

The first step in implementing any algorithm is understanding how to represent relevant data in a computer. So, how would we represent a graph in memory?

There are really just two ways:

1. Adjacency Matrix
2. Adjacency List

Today, we&#39;re going to use the first one. Take a look at the image below:

![matrix and graph representation](//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/446c623541ed9008901f76c1b05ff5526f4fcee0.png)

On the left, what is shown is a graph much like the one from the [first part of this series](https://0x00sec.org/t/graph-algorithms-part-1-0-dijkstras-shortest-path-concept/419). To the right of that graph is its corresponding representation in an adjacency matrix.

This particular adjacency matrix is a Boolean one: a `1` means that an edge connects the two nodes. A matrix&#39;s values can also be used to keep track of distances.

&gt; Note: A matrix is represented in computer as a 2D array. The outer array makes up the rows; the inner the columns. Generally:  `some_matrix[row][col]`.

----
# Let&#39;s Start Coding

```java
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;limits&gt;

int dijkstra(std::vector&lt; std::vector&lt;int&gt; &gt;&amp; matrix, int start, int end) {

	std::vector&lt;int&gt; distances(matrix.size()), previous(matrix.size());
	std::vector&lt;int&gt; nodes, path;

        // ...
```
We include our headers and then declare the function `dijkstra`. This function takes, as parameters, an adjacency matrix represented by a 2D `std::vector`, a starting point, and an ending point. The start/end points are assumed to be from a zero-based index.

Then, we declare a few more vectors.

* `distances` will keep track of the distance between each node and the `start` node.
* `previous` keeps track of the order of visitation of the nodes.
* `nodes` is a `std::vector&lt;int&gt;` containing all of the nodes.
* `path` is simply the path to take from `start` to `end`. It&#39;s empty because we have yet to find the path.

```java
       // ...

        for (int i = 0, n = matrix[start].size(); i &lt; n; i++) {

		if (i == start)
			distances[i] = 0;
		else
			distances[i] = std::numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max();

		nodes.push_back(i);
	}

        // ...
```
We now go through each node, and set the distance to &quot;infinity,&quot; represented by the maximum value of an integer (`numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max()`). _But_, if the `i`th node is our `start` node, we set the distance to `0`. We then `push_back` each node.

```java
        // ...
        auto comp = [&amp;](int l, int r) {return distances[l] &gt; distances[r];};
	std::sort(nodes.begin(), nodes.end(), comp);

        // ...
```
Okay, that first line there seems a little daunting. Basically, we create a custom comparator, so that we can sort `nodes` by the distance between each node and `start`, with the smallest distances at the end, or back, of `nodes`.

```java
        // ...
        while(!nodes.empty()) {
		int smallest = nodes.back();
		nodes.pop_back();

		if (smallest == end) {

			while(smallest != start) {

				path.push_back(smallest);
				smallest = previous[smallest];
			}
			
			path.push_back(start);
			std::reverse(path.begin(), path.end());
			break;
		}

		if (distances[smallest] == std::numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max())
			break;

		for(int i = 0, n = matrix[smallest].size(); i &lt; n; i++) {
			int tmp = distances[smallest] + matrix[smallest][i];
			
			if (tmp &lt; 0)
				tmp = std::numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max();
				// combat integer overflow!
			
			if (tmp &lt; distances[i]) {
				distances[i] = tmp;
				previous[i] = smallest;

				std::sort(nodes.begin(), nodes.end(), comp);
			}
		}
	}
        // ...
```
Now we enter a `while` loop, which says, &quot;while we still have nodes...&quot; The first thing we&#39;re going to do is take the smallest node in `nodes` and &quot;visit&quot; it by popping it off of `nodes` and storing it in `smallest`.

Skip those first two `if`s and go to that `for` loop. This loop says, &quot;for each node connected to `smallest`, do...&quot;

In the loop, we first make a variable `tmp` equal to the sum of `distances[smallest]` and `matrix[smallest][i]`. This means, `tmp` is equal to the distance from `start` to `smallest` plus the distance from `smallest` to node `i`. `tmp` is, therefore, a possible distance from `start` to node `i`. But, we only want to use this distance if it&#39;s less than the one we _already_ may have.

First, let&#39;s make sure we didn&#39;t add `numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max()` to some number above zero and accidentally overflow `tmp` to the negatives. We correct `tmp` to `numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max()` if we _did_ overflow it. 

Now we&#39;re at the second `if` in the `for` loop. If `tmp` is smaller than `distances[i]`, it means that we have found a better route from `start` to `i`. So, we update the distance and record that the node we visit before `i` should be `smallest`. Since we have updated a distance, we also need to re`sort` `nodes`.

Okay, let&#39;s go back to the first `if` in the `while` loop. If/when we reach the end, the code inside this `if` runs. We build up the `path` by calling on previous, and then recursively defining `smallest` as the `smallest` that came before it. Then, we `push_back( start )` to complete the path. We have to `reverse` it first, though, since the first element in `path` is `end` and the last is `start`.

The second `if` in the `while` loop handles the corner case of not being able to reach `end` from `start`. If the smallest distance is `numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max()`, our &quot;infinity&quot;, then `end` can never be reached.

```java
        // ...
        for(auto&amp; v : path) std::cout &lt;&lt; v &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot;;
        	std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;

        	return distances[end];
    } // end of dijkstra()
```
In this final snippet of `dijkstra`, we print out the `path` and then `return distances[end]`, the distance from `start` to `end`.

I&#39;ll leave the `main()` function up to you guys, but [here](http://pastebin.com/F8TpzSsc) is the source for this post. ___Note:___ _I have slightly modified the code shown here for simplicity and/or the tutorial&#39;s sake._ There is a main function in [that](http://pastebin.com/F8TpzSsc), but feel free to make your own, as long as it satisfies the adjacency matrix.

# Conclusion

That&#39;s all for today. Next time, I&#39;ll be rolling out a (much) more optimized version of the algorithm that takes advantage of adjacency lists and more concise coding techniques I have omitted from this for clarity reasons.</description>
