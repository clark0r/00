    <title>Question about porting Wifi Pineapple firmware</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/question-about-porting-wifi-pineapple-firmware/4935</link>
    <description>So I recently got a cheap [OpenWRT Router](https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/nexx/wt3020#hardware_details) from gear best with the hopes of turning it into a wifi pineapple type device. After looking around a bit I stumbled across this [Wifi Pineapple firmware port](http://sapinski.com/2016/02/13/wifi-pineapple-firmware-for-gl-inet-gl-ar150/) for the GL-AR150 router and was wondering if it would be possible to do the same for my WT3020h? I&#39;m really new to hardware stuff and wouldn&#39;t even know where to begin when trying to port a firmware like this so hopefully someone could give me a little insight on it.</description>

            <p>Ahh yea that makes sense. Ohh well I guess this gives me a reason to try and put something of my own together for it</p>
<p>Thanks for the help <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/0xff7">@0xff7</a></p>
<p>At first glance looks like your WT3020H uses a different SoC (MediaTek MT7620N). The GL-AR150, on the other hand has, apparently, the same SoC than the pineapple (Atheros AR9331), so I bet you cannot proceed as per the link you found.</p>
<p>You can get the pineapple firmware and extract it (using the tool mentioned in the link or <code>binwalk -e</code>). Then copy one of the binaries (and maybe some libs) into your OpenWRT router and try to run it. If it works then, you may have a chance…</p>
<p>I do not own any of the mentioned devices so I cannot really say much more <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
Hope this helps</p>
