    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/what-is-best-methodology-for-discovery-vulnerability-and-exploit-development-in-binary-software/25419</link>
    <description>I&#39;m new in Exploit Development and Discovery Vulnerability. I learning some technique by some course and books.I have learned Stack Buffer Overflow and Heap Buffer Overflow and Format Strings and some bypass technique for ASLR,NX,DEP , .... .
But I think its only technique and I need a methodology for best performance in discovery vulnerability in binary software.
so,what is best methodology for discovery vulnerability and Exploit Development in binary software?</description>
