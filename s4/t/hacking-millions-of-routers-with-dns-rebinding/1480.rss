    <title>Hacking Millions of Routers with DNS Rebinding</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/hacking-millions-of-routers-with-dns-rebinding/1480</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been doing some thinking about DNS Rebinding, and I think this could be really insightful to a lot of you out there.

I found this a while ago, (Def Con rocks), and he is speaking about bypassing Same Origin Policy in order to execute code on machine on your local network using DNS Rebinding. I figured this would be helpful to those PLC hackers out there. However I am not sure if it still works. Leave your thoughts.
