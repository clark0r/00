    <description>hello 

I&#39;m new to fuzzing , I only used spike fuzzer one years ago. some friend recommend to use AFL in fuzzing , but when I search google all tutorials on linux platform, does AFL support windows if yes , Do you guys recommend any tutorials. if it does not support windows , do you guys recommend any alternative ?

thank you</description>

            <p>Originally American fuzzy lop  is a fuzzer for usage on UNIX based systems.<br>
Due to the sheer popularity and greatness of afl  some forks appeared like <a href="https://github.com/ivanfratric/winafl">winafl</a>.<br>
I never tried it but it still seems to be maintained since the last commit was 3 days ago.</p>
<p>No guarantee on that this fork is as good/fast as the original implementation tho since it does not seem to use any form of binary instrumentation during compile time.</p>
<p>As for other  recommendations I honestly have no idea. I only fuzzed on UNIX based systems</p>
