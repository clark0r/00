    <description>I was checking up on his website and saw he now offers &#39;confidante&#39; services where you get 24/hr access to him for $500 a year. I&#39;m not one to dish out money for any kind of course, but I was wondering if anyone here has and if so, how was it??</description>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/zsec">@zSec</a> Ofcourse it is better than CEH when you look at it technically because CEH is a joke. But ironically many jobs require you to have the cert.</p>
<p>I’m not interested in his certs, but more in his articles on SCADA hacking because I work in EE in industrial environments.</p>

            <p>OTW is OccupyTheWeb, a former NullByte member who wrote many good articles(and even had a contract with them). When we split from NullByte(when he got fired), he made a website on his own where he does some posts and sells some certification (trainings?).<br>

            <p>The only thing I did was the CWA Certification for 99$.<br>
I’m looking forward for the next level certs, CWE and CWP.</p>
<p>The CWA is a very good entry level cert for whit hat hackers and is (in my point of view) already better then the CEH by EC-Counsil.<br>
I’m really looking forward for the next ones because these will be also practical, so you really have to hack a system (CTF kinda thing I suppose). The CWE should be available around June this year.</p>
<p>I haven’t heard about the 24/hr access yet. What exactly is that?</p>
