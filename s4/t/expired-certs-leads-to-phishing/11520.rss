    <title>Expired certs leads to phishing?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/expired-certs-leads-to-phishing/11520</link>
    <description>Hello

I have been reading the feeds lately, recently many feeds are showing reminders to renew certificate before expiry, failure to do that would risk hackers launching phishing attempts.

I have been wondering, how does cert expiry and phishing co-relate? Apart from the warning from the browser of course.</description>

            <p>A valid certificate should be a kind of confirmation that the content you are looking at was made by the people serving the content.<br>
With a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" rel="nofollow noopener">MITM</a> a bad actor (let’s call her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob" rel="nofollow noopener">Mallory</a>) could try to serve you content that was manipulated. (for example a password field that sends all input to Mallory’s server)<br>
But if Mallory tries to reroute HTTPS without preparation, it will show an invalid certificate.<br>
Thus if a website owner is not making sure that the certificate is valid, there is no (easy) way to know for a user if the content served is safe and hasn’t been tampered with.</p>
