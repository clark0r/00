    <title>Canary Tokens - The Zero setup honeypot</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/canary-tokens-the-zero-setup-honeypot/22275</link>
    <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://canarytokens.org&quot;&gt;**CanaryTokens**&lt;/a&gt;  is a  free offering by  &lt;a href=&quot;https://canary.tools/&quot;&gt;Thinkst Canary&lt;/a&gt; a  Haas(Honeypot as a service provider) provider ,  although it exists since 2015 , i came across it  recently and thought it was worth sharing (and also because our Blue Team Category looked a little pale ) . 

So what can canarytokens do  ?
-
Canary Tokens is  what we could call subscribe and forget  honeypot service all you need to do is head over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://canarytokens.org&quot;&gt;**canarytokens.org**&lt;/a&gt;  and choose a  token that fits you , there are old school  url bugs to Bitcoin addresses to AWS keys , all you need to do is choose a token that fits you  ,  write a note to yourself on why you created the token and provide a email  to which the alert will be sent when a token is triggered  that&#39;s it , zero hackery involved . Now its time for you to get creative and put  the tokens in the right place , my personal favourite is the AWS access token , i suggest you guys get one now and throw it in your home directory and forget about it  :smile: .

Dockerized  CanaryTokens :
-
If anybody  wants  their own  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens-docker&quot;&gt;**CanaryTokens**&lt;/a&gt;  setup , its just a` git clone` and `docker-compose up` away , it provides almost all the feature available on the site .


What about SSH , FTP , telnet , git ...........?
-
Well canary tokens can&#39;t exactly do that , but hey there&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencanary.readthedocs.io/&quot;&gt;**Open Canary**&lt;/a&gt;   , it can emulate  a bunch of services and send alerts to email when triggered , i found it to be quick and easy to deploy , give it a shot.</description>
