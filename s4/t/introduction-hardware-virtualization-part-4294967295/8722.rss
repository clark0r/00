    <description>&lt;h3&gt;Introduction: Hardware Virtualization - Part #4294967295&lt;/h3&gt;

Hey ho fellow 0x00ers,

Over the last weeks I have researched and wrote some articles about hardware virtualization. Nearly half of the planned articles are done. I will finish the other ones when I have some more time.
Anyway, the important thing I have to mention is, that these articles only focus on Intel’s _hardware_ virtualization technologies and x86_64 processors! On top of that, I only cover a fraction of the existing ways to virtualize software. 

Nonetheless, I hope you get a deeper understanding how your VMs are kept running and how they protect you. So put your mining hat on, it is going deep down --&gt;

Part #0 - [Basics and life cycle of a VM](https://0x00sec.org/t/basics-and-lifecycle-of-a-vm-part-0/8723)
Part #1 - [The VMCS](https://0x00sec.org/t/the-vmcs-part-1/8739)
Part #2 - [A lot about Paging, a little about virtualization](https://0x00sec.org/t/a-lot-about-paging-a-little-about-virtualization-part-2/8868/2)
Part #3 - VT-d
Part #4 - Three cheers for Qubes
Part #5 - Write up of a Qubes/Xen exploit
Part #X - Don&#39;t know yet, depends on my motivation, maybe something about Para-Virtualization.
