    <title>Segfaults With Polycrypt Tutorial</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/segfaults-with-polycrypt-tutorial/6713</link>
    <description>Had a question about this tutorial:

https://0x00sec.org/t/polycrypt-experiments-on-self-modifying-programs/857

I&#39;ve tried double-checking the code several times. Even tried pulling it off this github to ensure I wasn&#39;t missing anything:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00pf/0x00sec_code/master/crypter/polycrypt.c

Every time I try to run it I get the following though:

$ ./polycrypt 
mprotect:: Cannot allocate memory
Segmentation fault

At first I thought this may be some security feature on my device that was preventing that. However, I was able to execute the code in the link below that also calls mprotect without issue:

https://shanetully.com/2013/12/writing-a-self-mutating-x86_64-c-program/

I was very far from running low on memory with my device, so I do not think this was due to low resources. I suspect that as I&#39;m using x86_64, maybe some of the offsets and code in polycrypt.c were to be used with i386? 

That&#39;s just a guess, but I&#39;m interested on anyone&#39;s thoughts on this.</description>

            <p>Well, I would make a pull request, but it seems github just flagged my account. Guess they don’t like privacy settings. I contacted them, but not sure how long it will take for them to review it. I’ll try to do that when/if they let me back on. lol</p>

            <p>Now you can try to make it work with <code>PIE</code> binaries. Hint:  Check /proc/PID/maps to figure out the real address at run-time.</p>
<p>Do not forget to make a PR on my repo if you make it work <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I found ‘-no-pie’ wasn’t in the Makefile from the github, but added it like so:</p>
<p>$ cat Makefile<br>
all:prog crypter_rt polycrypt</p>
<p>crypter_rt:crypter_rt.c<br>
${CC} -no-pie -Wall -o $@ $&lt;</p>
<p>prog:prog.c<br>
${CC} -no-pie -Wall -o $@ $&lt;</p>
<p>polycrypt:polycrypt.c<br>
${CC} -no-pie -Wall -o $@ $&lt;<br>
.PHONY:<br>
clean:<br>
rm prog crypter_rt polycrypt</p>
<p>After that it ran perfect. Much thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/ph33r">@ph33r</a></p>
<p>Looks like the error you are actually getting is <code>ENOMEM</code> (check the <code>mprotect</code> man page for details). This normally means that the address you are passing as a parameter is wrong. So my best guess is that you have generated a <code>PIE</code> binary.</p>
<p>To play with program compile it as a normal binary (<code>-no-pie</code> flag?). Otherwise you can try to fix <code>polycrypt</code> to work with <code>PIE</code> binaries, which is, I think, an interesting exercise.</p>
<p>Let me know if that is the case (a <code>PIE</code> binary). Otherwise I may need more details to figure out what is wrong as the program works fine in all my boxes.</p>
