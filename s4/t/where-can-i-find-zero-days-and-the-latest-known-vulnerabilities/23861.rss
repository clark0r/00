            <p>I believe that it would be much harder to find 0days since companies would likely patch these things up though if you are just looking for latest exploits or known vulnerabilities, you could check out exploitdb.</p>
<p>Additional info, you could go and checkout twitter and follow legitimate security researchers and companies to get the latest updates.</p>
