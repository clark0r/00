            <p>Before you start learning, as you mention you’ve had trouble learning in the past I’d step back and consider how you learn so you can approach the process in the best way for you. Set appropriate goals for yourself, actively engage in learning - write notes, make mindmaps, practical exercises - a mix of techniques.</p>
<p>For learning Python, I’d recommend ‘Learn Python 3 The Hard Way’. Despite its name, it’s a solid introduction to python. I find it helpful to mix reading with video, perhaps check out farshields youtube suggestion (although I haven’t watched it).</p>
<p>Finally, understanding as much computer science as possible will help you along your programming journey. Harvard’s CS50 (<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science</a>) is highly praised, and I can vouch for its excellence.</p>

            <p>If you have no previous experience with programming, I recommend this website: <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://automatetheboringstuff.com/</a> (scroll down to the bottom for the table of contents).</p>
<p>There is also a YT channel everybody seems to recommend if videos are your preferred way of learning (but I personally never watched that channel): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5/playlists" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5/playlists</a></p>
