    <title>Great way to learn Linux</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/great-way-to-learn-linux/863</link>
    <description>Few weeks ago I ran into this tutorial series of an obviously experienced linux user. It starts assuming you know nothing and is meant to prepare you for  Linux Professional Institute&#39;s 101 exam, however I find it as a good reference for many things, including inodes, globing, regex introduction, FHS, process control, text processing and even partitioning.
