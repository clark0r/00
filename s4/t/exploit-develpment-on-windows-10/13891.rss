    <title>Exploit develpment on windows 10</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/exploit-develpment-on-windows-10/13891</link>
    <description>I would like to setup an exploit development on windows 10 x64 bits 

- Immunity debugger x86 apps
- wingdb 
- IDA
- process explorer 
- buch of vulnerable apps(securityfocus,exploitdb , etc)

Templates  C/C++ for exploitation (if you could borrow me some )

- Saved Return Pointer overwrites
- Structured Exception Handling
- Bad Characters
- Limited buffers
- Egg hunters
- Introduction to shellcoding
- Metasploit modules
- Unicode buffers (if I found samples real world)
- Bypassing ASLR
- Bypassing DEP

what else?</description>

            <p>Exploiting a browser and escaping their respective sandboxes has nothing to with the kernel…The kernel sits several layers below a web browser, it has no concept of what a web browser is.</p>
<p>This is not to say that you couldn’t cause affects that impact the way a  browser behaves from the kernel, I’m just saying you don’t need to know kernel exploitation/kernel development to successfully exploit popular browsers</p>

<p>if I want to exploit IE, edge , chrome , safari and sandbox bypass . should I need kernel or do I still need JS core / webkit ?</p>

            <p>Get a windows internals book? I personally don’t know what the differences are on a very low level but if you’ve gone through all the corelan stuff and you’re not doing kernel hacking then it should be more or less the same across the board.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you’re looking for things to practice or do, I’d really recommend you go through Corelan’s exploit writing tutorial/series or something like it instead of trying to do everything in your own self-made sandbox. There will be gotchas that you won’t know how to deal with unless you go through a tutorial that can warn you about them and help you avoid them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I did the corelan tutorials along with fuzzy one, except browwser &amp; kernel exploitation  because  I need some more free time to practice but I would like to host my own self-made sandbox.. how can I setup for windows 10 instead of windows xp , 7 ?</p>
