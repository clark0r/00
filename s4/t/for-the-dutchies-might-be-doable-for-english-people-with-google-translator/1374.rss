    <title>For the Dutchies (might be doable for English people with google translator)</title>

    <description>So the Dutch intelligence agency has posted a Christmas Puzzel.
It&#39;s related to cryptography and steganography mainly.
The puzzel is in dutch, but I think a lot of them can be made by English people as well.
You can find the puzzel here:
https://www.aivd.nl/binaries/aivd_nl/documenten/publicaties/2016/12/12/kerstpuzzel-2016/Kerstpuzzel+2016.pdf

So I did the first 2 and I think googling the Dutch version of some words having to do with the theme &#39;Christmas&#39; might help the English people trying this.

I&#39;d say it being a foreign language makes it a bigger challenge.
There is no guide besides what&#39;s in the file.</description>

            <p>Yes and no. On paper they are an intelligence agency, but in reality they’re only there to offer intelligence to police forces in the field and not actually “spying” suspects.</p>
<p>If they did the latter, 13 November wouldn’t have happened.</p>
