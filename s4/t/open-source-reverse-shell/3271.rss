    <title>Open Source Reverse Shell</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/open-source-reverse-shell/3271</link>
    <description>Ok, so I&#39;ve coded a very basic reverse shell that I&#39;ve now decided to allow any member  to access and view the code, but before I post the code I gotta thank @0x00pf for his awesome [tutorial](https://0x00sec.org/t/remote-shells-part-i/269) and @Joe_Schmoe for  [STELF](https://gitlab.s-3.tech/JSchmoe/unnamed-shell) which inspired me to code this shell. I&#39;m trying to add functionality to my shell, but I&#39;m a 1337 Skid haxor. I&#39;m still learning but thanks to this community and their patience especially @_py and of course @pry0cc plus many others which helped me and answered my really really really dull questions. I&#39;ve learned a lot coding this shell especially how file descriptors and sockets work. Thank you all that have helped me out quite a bit! 

Now the [code](https://gitlab.s-3.tech/v02alentine/reverse_shell) is written in C and I&#39;ve added comments to any that are interested in how it all works. To compile simply do,
``
gcc reverse_shell.c -o reverse_shell
``

and for the handler same thing,
``
gcc handler.c -o handler
``

The file named shell.c is actually a bind shell which I accidentally coded and just shows how stupid I can be, but I&#39;ve decided to keep it just in case I and anyone else finds it useful. I hope this becomes useful for anyone that is interested. If anyone wants to help with the development of the shell please request access. Thank you!

Cheers!</description>

            <p>Reverse Shell is more reliable than a bind shell because of Firewalls. Most Firewalls will actually not allow you to bind to the port that a bind shell needs which is why reverse shell are ideal because of the fact that they “call home”.</p>
