    <title>What is your smartphone?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/what-is-your-smartphone/2230</link>
    <description>Hello members,
I just joined this forum and is a nice place to meet people and discuss, I&#39;m really happy for this.

Now I want to ask if you have got a smartphone, and what do you have, if is Rooted (Android) or Jail-broken (iPhone), ROM, recovery, kernel, security/privacy apps, and whatever you have in your smartphone, please don&#39;t share strict personal information (as phone number).

**My phone**
I have a Motorola Moto G3 (2015) with Resurrection Remix (7.1.1 Nougat), Fire Kernel and TWRP as recovery, without Google Services (I&#39;m using MicroG), is pretty old but it never crash/freeze so its doing the work well.

If you want you can upload too a homepage screen of your phone!</description>

            <p>I got my phone off ebay for $200 &amp; it’s the first smartphone I’ve owned. It’s served me well for what it is.</p>
<p>It’s a Sony Xperia C4 E5353. It is indeed rooted, but I had to wait until the C5 was released before someone found a way to root it. It’s running the stock 5.1 rom. No one makes roms for this phone &amp; I’m too scared of hard bricking it to compile and flash a rom myself. I use TWRP for my recovery. I have Xposed installed. I replaced my nav buttons and notification bar icons with an app from Xposed. Everything else is stock and I’m not concerned too much about security on it.</p>

<p>I’m planning on buying a OnePlus 5 once my wallet recovers a bit from buying an Oculus Rift.</p>

            <p>Ah, this is the thread I’ve been craving <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I’ve had multiple phones, most of which have expired due how poor they are at lithobraking. <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/what-is-your-smartphone/2230/44">spoiler</a></span><br>
Anyway, here are some screenshots of the phone’s I have abused so far:</p>
<h2>– LG G3 (D855) –</h2>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/f/fed417f349c5a956d6e3d37282204701603d7040.png" width="281" height="500"></p>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/4577e4605df4e3deb0b21b1d598a66d0c45ab5c4.png" width="281" height="500"></p>
<p>The LG D855, was the first phone I got a chrooted Linux distro running on. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.meefik.linuxdeploy" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Linux Deploy</a> is nice and all, but I felt like doing the heavy lifting myself and I felt pretty annoyed with Nethunter not being released for my phone, so after rooting this device, I downloaded a small live <a href="https://www.kali.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Kali</a> image, put it on the SD Card, wrote a few scripts to mount it correctly and within around a day, I had a surprisingly functional Linux system!</p>
<p>Until the digitizer broke that is. But no worries, development continued with my next great phone that happened to be the:</p>
<h2>– Motorola Moto G (2015) –</h2>
<p><img src="//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/1/16238469c4c5f4f1570974ab46d5a390bc18607d.png" width="281" height="500"></p>

<p>Feel free to roast its measly specs, its chubby form and its rubbery back cover, but there’s just something about having a resilient phone in your pocket that is busy running a few chatbots and a webserver <em>just because it can</em>  <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>The Moto G really is a joy to mess with and rooting it is an absolute breeze. The scripts written for the G3 ran without any modification other than changing the path to the image, proving that this phone is simply a must have for anyone who is keen on Android development. Unfortunately, it’s screen is surprisingly brittle so watch out for that.</p>
<p>And this brings me to my current phone, the Xiaomi Redmi 4a, still running its stock, unrooted MIUI 8.1.4 ROM, due to the fact that Xiaomi haven’t  released the source code to the kernel, limiting the amount of development that can be done here. It’s still a great everyday phone, if you’re alright with the iOS rip off of a ROM, and its surprisingly well built for a budget phone.</p>

            <p>Yes that is definitely true. However there are some situations where the tools need to be run on the device like classdumpz. Also there are a few tools that are iOS only. I always just SSH into the device to run them tho as I hate working in the terminal on the phone itself</p>

            <p>Oh awesome!<br>
Didn’t know you could install these type of tools on iOS and it seems great, thanks for the information<br>
But a laptop will be the best mobile tool you can have.</p>

            <p>My main phone is an iPhone 6+ jailbroken on iOS 10.2. I have a system wide dark mode using Noctis 10 and Eclipse 4, as well as a couple other tweaks to make the UI more preferable.</p>
<p>I also have a couple iPhone 4’s that I use for learning iOS security and exploitation which are also jailbroken on iOS 7.1.2. On these devices I strictly install tools that I need/use for research such as cycript, LLVM + clang, radare2, and BigBoss Recommended tools.</p>

            <p>No, but you get full root access.<br>
For installing kernel or custom rom you need different type of exploit (u don’t need only the one for jailbreak the iphone).</p>

<p>For a phone, taking pictures, and social media, an iPhone is a really good platform. But as soon as you want to do fun stuff (root and customization), Android is king.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Totally agree with that. An iPhone does what it is supposed to do and it does it pretty good tbh but that is where it ends, and I just need to customize and overclock my phone to the max! Sure an iPhone can be jailbroken, but jailbreaking is basically turning your iPhone into a non-rooted device (installing apps outside the playstore, changing launchers, etc. are all possible in standard android.)</p>
