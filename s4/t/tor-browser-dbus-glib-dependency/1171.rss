    <title>Tor Browser: dbus-glib dependency</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/tor-browser-dbus-glib-dependency/1171</link>
    <description>I thought this could be helpful to someone running the Tor Browser.

Firefox requires a dependency &#39;dbus-glib&#39;, so does Tor Browser, since it is based on firefox. I required this dependency on my arch pc to run tor browser successfully. So if you don&#39;t have firefox installed, just get this dependency and run the Tor Browser without any issues. It worked for me.
