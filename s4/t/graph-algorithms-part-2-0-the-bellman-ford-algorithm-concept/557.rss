    <title>Graph Algorithms (Part 2.0): The Bellman-Ford Algorithm [Concept]</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/graph-algorithms-part-2-0-the-bellman-ford-algorithm-concept/557</link>
    <description>Hello 0x00sec people! It&#39;s @oaktree once again coming at you with another tutorial. This time, it&#39;s about the [Bellman-Ford Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm).

This algorithm is very similar to Dijkstra&#39;s Algorithm from [last time](https://0x00sec.org/t/graph-algorithms-part-1-1-dijkstras-shortest-path-code-v1/482/1), yet it diverges in that it is designed to handle _negative edge weights_, which are &quot;negative distances,&quot; in a way.

The use of the algorithm is two-fold: determine the shortest path between a starting node and all other nodes in a graph; and, determine if there are any _negative cycles_. A __negative cycle__ is when traversing the same path again makes the distance smaller. This would continue and approach negative infinity if we kept traversing the same _negative cycle_.

---
# Applications 
I&#39;m paraphrasing [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm) here. This algorithm is used in the [Routing Information Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_Information_Protocol) (*cough* @airth). This allows each node in a network to know how far every other node is. Each node calculates the distance between it and all other reachable nodes, and then sends that information to _all_ the other nodes, so that all the nodes can update their information if/when a shorter path is discovered.

#Procedure

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/1X/4d78788f9adcdf7bd93d67c27660b7b6d122e1b3.png&quot; width=&quot;387&quot; height=&quot;385&quot;&gt;
_Image from [this guy&#39;s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obWXjtg0L64) wonderful Youtube video on the subject. You should all go watch that video and give him a like._

Alright: Here&#39;s an example of a graph with negative edge weights. Our algorithm is going to go through and find the shortest distance to each node from a starting node. For this example, our starting node will be `S`. Once it does, it&#39;ll go over it one more time. Any distances that get smaller will do so because of a negatively-weighted edge. When this happens, we have detected a _negative cycle_.

---
# Time Complexity
To ensure that we have found the shortest path, we&#39;ll iterate through the graph `|V| - 1` times, where `V` is the number of vertices. Then, we&#39;ll iterate through one last time to find the _negative cycles_.

All in all, the __time complexity__ boils down to `O(|V|*|E|)`, where `E` is the number of edges.

---
# Pseudocode

    bellman(start, graph, distances):
        for_each vertex in graph:
            distances[vertex] = infinity
        
        distances[start] = 0

        previous = Array of graph.vertex_count elements

        // find the minimum distances
        (graph.vertex_count - 1) times:
            for_each node in graph:
                for_each neighbor of node:
                    if distances[neighbor] &gt;  distances[node] + edge(node,neighbor):
                        distances[neighbor] = distances[node] + edge(node,neighbor)
                        previous[neighbor] = node
                    

        // go through one last time to check for negative cycles
        for_each node in graph:
            for_each neighbor of node:
                if distances[neighbor] &gt;  distances[node] + edge(node,neighbor):
                     print &quot;negative cycle found between &quot; + node + &quot; and &quot; + neighbor + &quot;\n&quot;

As you can see, the first thing we do is set each distance to `infinity`. Then, we make sure that `distances[start] = 0` because the distance between a node and itself should ideally be `0`.

I also made an array called `previous` just to keep track of the path -- not that it matters all that much for finding distances, though.

The next thing to do is iterate through the graph `|V| - 1` times. We go through each node&#39;s neighbors and see if we can find a better distance. If we do, we also update the `previous` element corresponding to the `neighbor`.

After all of those `|V| - 1` times (it _can_ be optimized, but I wouldn&#39;t want to cause confusion), we loop through once more to see if there are any negative cycles. `|V| - 1` times is enough iterations to determine the shortest distance, so if it&#39;s shorter now it _must_ be due to a negative edge weight, a _negative cycle_.

---
# Conclusion
That&#39;s about all the algorithm does. In _Part 2.1_ (I really like to stick with my conventions), we&#39;ll write out some C++ code to perform the algorithm.

Graph ya&#39; later,

            <p>You’re right. It is not the most efficient, because it takes a while for the results of the algorithm on one node to reach all the other ones. This can cause some messages to loop in the meantime.</p>

            <p>Good old RIP, the root of every routing protocol. Since RIP is rarely used in a company’s network, I assume Bellman-Ford isn’t the most efficient algo to get the job done and that’s why RIP’s  implementation has been fading away I guess. Good stuff oakey!</p>
