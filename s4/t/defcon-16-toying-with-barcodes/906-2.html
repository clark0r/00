    <title>DEFCON 16: Toying with Barcodes</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/defcon-16-toying-with-barcodes/906</link>
    <description>I really enjoyed this Defcon talk, because it&#39;s about something that we all see and use everyday, but probably take for granted. And yet, there is a whole world of interesting vulnerabilities and potential for exploitation attached. It&#39;s a good reminder to look for the stuff that hides in plain sight.

            <p>Watched the whole video! Definitely a good talk full of humor, but it also makes you think about the serious security problems. Anyway, great share! <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/thumbsup.png?v=9" title=":thumbsup:" class="emoji" alt=":thumbsup:"></p>
