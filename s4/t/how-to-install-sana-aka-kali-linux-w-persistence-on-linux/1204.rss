    <title>How to Install Sana aka. Kali Linux w/ Persistence on Linux</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/how-to-install-sana-aka-kali-linux-w-persistence-on-linux/1204</link>
    <description>Hello my lads. I take pride in using Linux, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to become proficient in this industry. With Linux being my recommended OS, I also encourage Sana as your go OS when needing effective tools.

**Installing Sana aka. Kali Linux**
There are many ways to install this platform, so I will cover the most basic one, being the fresh install, and a fresh install with Persistence, if you choose to configure that too.

**Step 1**
Install Sana from the official website www.kali.org/downloads 

**Step 2**
Download [UUI](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/) - if you&#39;re on WIndows of course (gross).  Otherwise simply skip this step as this is not needed for Linux.

**Step 3**
Now, (considering you&#39;re on Linux) make sure your USB is either an _ext3_ or _ext4_ format, _fat32_ is also okay. If it&#39;s _ntfs_, you&#39;ll have to format your drive either in the linux terminal or with Gparted. I will show you how to do it in the terminal.

Type: **mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdx** 
This will format the drive to an ext4 format making it compatible with Linux. Replace the &#39;x&#39; with your letter. Usually _a_ or _b_ 

Type: **sudo dd if=path_of_your_iso of=/dev/sdx**
This will write your iso being Sana, to your USB drive. It can take up to about 8 minutes.

This is a very quick and easy way to install Sana on a USB with literally two commands. 1 if you already have a USB drive compatible with Linux. 

-----

If you are on Windows, I can only advise you to find a tutorial on Google because I run Linux like a savage. 

----
**Configuring Persistence on Sana aka. Kali Linux**

**Step 1**
Boot into Sana as the main host. You might have to go into your BIOS settings and change the boot order.

**Step 2**
Open up a terminal and type: sudo mkdir -p /mnt/my_usb
Find your drive &amp; remember it.

**Step 3**
mount /dev/sdx /mnt/my_usb
This will mount your device

**Step 4**
echo &quot;/ union&quot; &gt; /mnt/my_usb/persistence.conf
This will append the persistence file where you&#39;ll put your stuff!

**Step 5**
umount /dev/sdx &amp;&amp; reboot
This will unmount your USB.

Thats it.</description>
