    <description>Some time ago, my colleague and I decided to write a project for engineering work(Bachelor degree) at the end of my studies. But after a while, my friend stopped talking and act very wired and I have a problem because I can not finish the project for myself.

Can you recommend a project for a bachelor degree, so that it would be related to security, monitoring environments such as banking environments and detecting threats coming from outside? I will be grateful for every hint.</description>

            <p>How about fraud analyze based for banking transaction? Maybe you can use Machine Learning and sample data from a bank for classification and training.</p>
<p>For general, how about log parsing or visualization such as kibana? Maybe you can customize with your preference.</p>

            <p>Pretty broad. What things are you good at, do something that shows off your skills.</p>

            <p>You could make a network analyzer, which will monitor the traffic and based on types pf requests and packets you can program to detect and predict potential threats!<br>
OR<br>
You could work on solutions for wifi deauth attack problems, that would be neat.</p>
