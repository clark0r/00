    <title>[C] Dynamic Memory (Part 1.0): Stack v. Heap</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/c-dynamic-memory-part-1-0-stack-v-heap/960</link>
    <description>Alright! After receiving [positive responses to my proposal](https://0x00sec.org/t/gauging-interest-in-c-array-series/957), I&#39;m ready to start this [C] Dynamic Memory series.

Here are some suggested prerequisites:

* Basic Understanding of [Imperative Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming)
* Basic C Programming Knowledge
* Confidence with Pointers
    * And what pointers represent

Whether or not you meet the above conditions to a tee, feel free to read the rest of this article (and the rest of the series).

# The Stack

Each program, and each thread in a program, has a finite amount of memory to work with, allocated by the operating system, called [the stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation). If you attempt to use too much memory on the stack, you can trigger a stack overflow.

Other concerns aside, here are some instances in which the stack is used in C:

```c
int main(void) {
    // ...
        int x;
        char* c;
        int arr[6] = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
    // ...
}
```
Variables, pointers (themselves, not what they point to), and static arrays are all stored on the stack.

Here are a few links for my skeptics:

* [Pointers are stored on the stack.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24380935/where-are-pointers-in-c-stored-on-the-stack-or-in-the-heap)
* [Static Arrays are stored on the stack.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5258724/stack-variables-vs-heap-variables)

# The Heap

Aside from the stack, [the heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management#HEAP) (a.k.a. the _free store_) has more space but is often slower. I won&#39;t go into too much detail about the exact difference, but know that the heap is where you would allocate large amounts of memory, especially if you only know _how much_ memory you&#39;re allocating at runtime.

If you know how much memory you need at compile-time, the stack may be preferential. There are always exceptions.

Nonetheless, using the heap in C, or any language, takes a little more effort on the programmer&#39;s side.

```
int main(void) {
    // ...
        int *x;
        x = malloc( sizeof(int) );

        if (x == NULL)
            perror(&quot;Couldn&#39;t allocate for x&quot;);
    // ...
}
```

Above would be using the heap. Now time for a quick vocabulary session -- sort of:

___`malloc`___ is the function used to allocate a certain amount of memory on the heap. It takes one parameter: the number of bytes of memory to allocate.

To review, using `malloc` gets you some heap memory. But what should be done when the memory is no longer needed? Upon a program&#39;s finishing, most modern operating systems will do away with any heap-allocated stuff still remaining. However, if we want to ensure peak code efficiency, we must learn to get rid of no longer needed memory by ourselves.

___`free`___ does as you would expect. It frees up the memory pointed to by the parameter you pass it:

```c
//...
free(x);
//...
```

Passing `x` (our pointer from the example before this one) to `free` clears out the memory to which it points. You can pass any kind of pointer to `free`. You do not need to pass unassigned pointers, which point to no memory, or pointers that point to another pointer&#39;s memory to `free`.

You only free a block of memory ___once___. Freeing the same memory multiple times causes problems, as you&#39;ll find out throughout your journey with the C Programming Language. 

---
# Conclusion

All in all, `malloc` is how you obtain some memory; `free` is how you _release_ that memory. `malloc` and `free` are like [Yin and Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang): they should be balanced. Each call to `malloc` should be paired with __one__ call to `free`. For a program to achieve _inner peace_, you could say, it needs to be balanced between memory allocations and memory releases.

That&#39;s it for Stack v. Heap. Next time, we&#39;ll be exploring how to make and use heap-allocated arrays with `malloc` and `free`.

Later..

</aside>
<p>I agree completely with your statement, and this is probably the most important part of your article, well … from my point of view ! Moreover, to ensure a better memory management and avoid memories leaking, I advise using <a href="http://valgrind.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">valgrind</a>, tool sensible to memory usage issues !</p>
