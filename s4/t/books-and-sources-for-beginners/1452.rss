    <title>Books and Sources for Beginners</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/books-and-sources-for-beginners/1452</link>
    <description>Hi all, I&#39;m a new aspiring hacker and right now I&#39;m going through a couple of books about penetration testing but I&#39;m not sure if does books are enough for becoming a hacker. I have no intention of becoming good at things in a short amount of time, I know that I have to spend a lot of time in order to just start being good at things but I want to go learn with the right way. 

Are there any good sources that you recommend? It might be a book, a blog or something else but I believe that books are best learning sources for me. I believe this community will help me a lot along my path...

&lt;small&gt;P.S: Sorry for my bad English. I&#39;m not a native speaker  &lt;/small&gt;</description>

            <p>Thank you all for your advices. I’ll read Jan Wikholm’s experiences and I’ve decided to spend more time on CTF’s but is there a specific CTF site/contest you recommend for beginners? I have <a href="http://overthewire.org" rel="nofollow noopener">overthewire.org</a> as an option right now.</p>

            <p>Jan Wikholm wrote his experiences down and recorded them in a vlog from day 0 till his certificate of the OSCP. Tells you what he focussed on and what he used to attain his OSCP certificate.<br>
As said above, he learned loads from CTF’s.<br>

            <p>Honestly, the best way (in my opinion) to learn this kind of thing is via CTFs (Capture the Flag competitions). They’re a great way to network and learn how to break into systems, plus if you’re good enough, some prize money might be involved too.</p>
<p>Feel free to join any of the ranked competitions <a href="https://ctftime.org" rel="nofollow noopener">here.</a></p>

<p>There is a link within there leading to the “CS50” course at Harvard. It’s like Computer Science 101, it gives basic knowledge on programming, encryption, forensics, how RAM works, networking and more.<br>
It’s not in-depth, but it’s very broad and gives you an overview of most fields required to become a master hacker.</p>

            <p>You certainly seem like somebody who has a realistic view of learning, and will probably go far with your apt attitude.</p>
<p>This isn’t a book, but it is very well written and perfect for beginners. Pico’s wannabe articles are perfect.</p>

<p>By following these articles, and taking the direction, you can get pretty good pretty fast as long as you have a fairly decent understanding of basic hardware.</p>
<p>Good luck! Remember, the IRC has usually always got somebody on, solving problems, or solving understanding is super useful there. I learned a tonne from <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/ioth1nkn0t">@IoTh1nkN0t</a> in the early days about the stack. I’m sure he remembers it too!</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>
