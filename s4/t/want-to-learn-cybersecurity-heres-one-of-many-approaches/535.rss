    <title>Want to learn Cybersecurity? Here&#39;s one of many approaches</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/want-to-learn-cybersecurity-heres-one-of-many-approaches/535</link>
    <description>Hello everyone! Yesterday I came across a website that offers a lot of educational courses (This courses are only available in Portugal) and one of them caught my atention - &quot;Curso de Técnico Especialista em Cibersegurança&quot; or Techinal Specialist in Cybersecurity Course (the transaltion is a bit off, but you get the point). 

In the website, they have a .pdf file that lists the learning programme (all the the subjects and topics that you are going to learn if you take the course). The course lasts for 12 months and 3 of those months are some sort of internship.

 Honestly this looks like a great programme with some great subjects to learn about. In this article, I&#39;m going to translate the topics that are present on that .pdf file (since it&#39;s in portugese), in order to help beginners know where to start and also to help people that need a more pragmatic/systematic approach to learn hacking and cybersecurity.

To avoid an extremely long article, I&#39;m simply going to list the main topics without much detail, but if there is any particular topic you are curious/interested about, simply comment bellow, and I&#39;ll reply with a detailed list regarding the subjects discussed on that topic. 

Let&#39;s Begin:

* Professional Ethics and Deontology

* Probability and Statistics

* Mathematics

* Company - Structure and Functions

* First Concepts on Programming and Algorithms and Control Stuctures of a Computer Program

* Legislation, Security and Privacy

* Technical English

* Programming - Algorithms

* Database - Concepts

* Operating Systems (Client)

* Operating Systems (Server)

* Hardware and Computer Networks

* Computer Networks (Advanced)

* Installation of Local Networks

* Network Services

* Netork Management and Customer Support Models

* Basics of Cybersecurity

* Evidence Analysis Technologies

* Introduction to Programming Applied to Cybersecurity

* Introduction to Evidence Analysis Techniques

* Vulnerability Analysis - Introduction

* Vulnerability Analysis - Development

* Introduction to Cybersecurity and Cyberdefense

* Operating Framework for Cybersecurity

* Active Cybersecurity

* Wargamming

That&#39;s all! Like I said before, if there is any topic that you&#39;d like to know more about, simply comment the name of the topic and I&#39;ll reply with all the details!</description>

            <p>Sounds like you and I would get along. Former corrections officer and lifelong nerd. I’m currently learning Linux as well since all I know is Windows. I wish it had been possible to go to school for it but I can’t afford it, for now I will teach myself online like everything else I want to learn.</p>

            <p>I am studying Linux through hackers arise. It seemed like the best place to start. You confirmed that-thank you.</p>
<p>I have a bachelors in Criminal Justice and some courses in Computer Science. I dropped out of Computer Science due to getting straight As without learning a thing. It is too much money and then to merely be handed an A without learning anything. It was disheartening.</p>
<p>Many questions I had were handled with a sweet voice saying “you don’t need to know honey. You’re getting an A”. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> Not cool!</p>
<p>I like people like you guys!!! I get to seriously learn! Thank you so much!!!</p>

            <p>I for myself use MEGA, because it’s extremely fast, you have much space and it’s completly free <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:">. If you have a look at my articles you’ll see every download link is directing to MEGA <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">.</p>
<p>And MEGA doesn’t delete nearly illegal stuff, e.g. a very big Cracked games publisher uses it for his games, which could be valuable sometimes… I never had any problems with it.</p>

            <p>I would also recommend studying different types of attacks, as well as having a good grip with networking. Programming too, but I suppose that can come later. I mean you need an understanding of something before you can actually program it.</p>

            <p>Seems like most of that is covered in the CEH, minus mathematics (unless they mean public key).</p>
<p>Yes, there are HUNDREDS of approaches to learning. The best thing to do is get familiar with ethics, laws, and linux.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello everyone! Yesterday I came across a website that offers a lot of educational courses (This courses are only available in Portugal) and one of them caught my atention - “Curso de Técnico Especialista em Cibersegurança” or Techinal Specialist in Cybersecurity Course (the transaltion is a bit off, but you get the point).</p>
<p>In the website, they have a .pdf file that lists the learning programme (all the the subjects and topics that you are going to learn if you take the course). The course lasts for 12 months and 3 of those months are some sort of internship.</p>
<p>Honestly this looks like a great programme with some great subjects to learn about. In this article, I’m going to translate the topics that are present on that .pdf file (since it’s in portugese), in order to help beginners know where to start and also to help people that need a more pragmatic/systematic approach to learn hacking and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>To avoid an extremely long article, I’m simply going to list the main topics without much detail, but if there is any particular topic you are curious/interested about, simply comment bellow, and I’ll reply with a detailed list regarding the subjects discussed on that topic.</p>
<p>Let’s Begin:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Professional Ethics and Deontology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Probability and Statistics</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Company - Structure and Functions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First Concepts on Programming and Algorithms and Control Stuctures of a Computer Program</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legislation, Security and Privacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical English</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programming - Algorithms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Database - Concepts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operating Systems (Client)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operating Systems (Server)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardware and Computer Networks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computer Networks (Advanced)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installation of Local Networks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network Services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Netork Management and Customer Support Models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basics of Cybersecurity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence Analysis Technologies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduction to Programming Applied to Cybersecurity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduction to Evidence Analysis Techniques</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vulnerability Analysis - Introduction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vulnerability Analysis - Development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduction to Cybersecurity and Cyberdefense</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Active Cybersecurity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wargamming</p>
</li>
