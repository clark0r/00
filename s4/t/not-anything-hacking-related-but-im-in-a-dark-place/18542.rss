    <title>Not Anything Hacking Related, But I&#39;m In a Dark Place</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/not-anything-hacking-related-but-im-in-a-dark-place/18542</link>
    <description>The title is self explanatory. I don&#39;t use social media besides this website, and I feel like I&#39;ve met so many kind people on here. I guess this is my call for help.

Last year, around March, a lot of stuff went down hill. Let&#39;s just say I made a lot of mistakes, and it broke my moms heart. I got sent to my dads during that time from March-June, and I&#39;ll be honest, depression really got the best of me. I was miserable every single day, and it got so bad to the point where I wanted to kill myself. As you can see, I didn&#39;t.

I was talking to my mom about some things today, and then somehow I was opening up to how I felt from March-June. She knows that I wanted to end it all, I&#39;ve spoken about it 3 times to her.

&quot;Remember what I told you a while back while we were going to your Pastor&#39;s moms funeral? And how I told you I wanted to...you get the gist?&quot; I asked. We were both already kinda upset at each other.

She said my name, and added, &quot;Don&#39;t try to make me feel bad about it. I&#39;m glad you went up to your dads and faced the stuff you faced. You stupid teenagers are gonna kill yourselves whether I stop you or not. I&#39;m not gonna hold you and say it&#39;s ok when it&#39;s not. It&#39;s an awful spirit. I&#39;m still gonna move on with my life. I&#39;m not gonna mourn and be brought down if you killed yourself.&quot;

I just...my heart is literally shattered. I decided to let things go and practice Elton John&#39;s &quot;Rocketman&quot; on piano, since I am performing it next Friday. At the ending when it repeats &quot;and I think it&#39;s gonna be a long, long time&quot; over and over again, I kinda lost it. I was sobbing really, really badly. :confused:

I have no words, actually. I&#39;m opening up to my mom about something so serious, and throughout the 3 times I&#39;ve talked to her about it, not once has she ever held me and told me things would be okay. All I got was a heaven/hell speech, and that it was my fault that all this stuff happened...

Friends of 0x00sec, can I please get some advice?</description>

            <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Yeah, those are most of the comments! That’s unfortunately all they can do, however, any advice is appreciated. (:</p>
<p>Wow, I’m very sorry about your brother, but I am very glad he’s alive today. I can’t imagine the pain of losing a family member to suicide.</p>
<p>Hey, that’s perfectly fine, I would love to become friends! As long as you’re not a 54 year old dude who likes to jerk off to little kids haha.</p>
<p>That’s very interesting! I got me a book on how to learn HTML and coding, and I can’t wait to learn more about it!</p>
<p>I’m sorry about your father. Maybe communication would work out soon in the future? I hope all is well. And since this post was posted back in January, and it is now close to April, I can honestly say my me and my mom’s relationship has smoothed up, thankfully.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful life man, you deserve it.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I hope this isn’t too weird. You don’t know me now, but you’ll know me soon (haha, not a weird brag or anything—I just tend to get very active in these communities and am already sure this will be one of my new favorites).</p>
<p>Above this post, I see many of my own sentiments already expressed (and I will do my best to repeat them). I also see (just a bit) of the “Cheer Up—It’ll All Be Okay” mentality… in their shoes, I would probably be the same … <em>grumble grumble grumble</em></p>
<p>I am bottoming out of my own depressive episod. Soon it will have been two years—a personal record.</p>
<p>I am also living with my (younger) brother. He is young, aleady has a fantastic career, was recently diagnosed Bipolar I, and has attempted suicide thrice in the past year (<strong>luckily</strong> he was absolutely trashed for the first two and I interrupted the third…and have since become a virtual shut-in).</p>
<p>As so many others have done already, I extend a hand of friendship (although I hope I am the only stranger among us).</p>
<p>I taught myself Python to pirate, kinda just stumbled into learning C# (and some C++, once upon a time) to bot, and now I’m…looking to throw a couple thousand hours learning how to actually code/hack.</p>
<p>My father and I don’t speak. He’s a massive cunt. Sounds like your mom might be one, too? Either way, FIDO (“Fuck It, Drive On”), brother.</p>
<p>;</p>

            <p>I understand you friend, I also had depression and I know very well that it seems that the world is against you! But what helped me, oddly enough, were studies and hackers (CTF, challenges, etc …) every time I struggled to understand a subject and, thus, being able to solve the CTF that I couldn’t before, motivated me a lot because the feeling of being able to do something that I couldn’t do before was very good. What I have to say is that you remain firm and raise your head, because, as you are here, you are probably someone who wants to improve your knowledge and grow in life, to be proud of all the victories you have achieved in life. Be the victories that you obtained by solving CTFs or even that reward of some video game. Learn from your mistakes, better your qualities and … Keep Hacking <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=9" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"> <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=9" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

            <p>Well if you ever remember how ARPANet was this is a lot like that, also it’s a lot like the early BBSs, and like a lot of positive communities are out there today, like this one (mostly gaming though I believe). You just need to look hard enough.</p>
<p>On a different note I don’t have a soul, lost it a long time ago, so computers is my passion and drive. A little edm, metalcore, trance thrown in helps too. Oh and to the OP I dumped my gf because I poured into her thousands of dollars, tons of emotional support, love and overall moved mountains for her on a regular basis. Yet I would always get the short end of the stick and would be broke most of the time. So yay for letting myself get abused but safe to say I had enough so I just cut her off, and now she can go fuck off.</p>
<p>Lesson is: If someone is pulling you down, tell them to go fuck off <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Holy crap man, I’m full-on crying right now. Tears of happiness, though, of course.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for this piece of advice. It really, really touched my heart that you found the time to tell me all of this. It woke me up by a long shot, I’ll be honest; that I need to appreciate more of what I got. Just know that everything you just said, I hope you realize that about yourself. That you are an amazing person who is loved, too, and that you’ll do so many great things in life. Helping a stranger (me) over the internet is one of them.</p>
<p>Again, this touched my heart. Thank you so much. You made my afternoon. I screenshotted your response, by the way, just in case if I need a little reminder. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Have an awesome life. You totally deserve it.</p>

            <p>I’d just like to say that it’s amazing to see everyone here post their own experiences and try to help you with your issues.</p>
<p>Now I’m not exactly that good with words and everything that I was going to say has already been said on here, and thus I’d just like to share something that really helped me when  I had to deal with bullying growing up.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sq60ccWHJcQ">A word on bullying.</a></p>

<p>I agreed with almost everything in the video (except for the part of not getting physical with bullies because damn that felt good to finally release all of my sadness and anger) but overall the video teached me a lot of things that I’ve been using up until now in life.</p>
<p>Even if you aren’t getting bullied it’s still an amazing resource to learn how to be stronger in life and thus I thought I’d share it here. <img src="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=15" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>Yea I agree it is not just a “choice” and you can not just “buck up” etc… but you can certainly change habits, find triggers, and so on and try and insulate yourself depression and change how you feel with movies and so on… but it is still hard and for some people it still is not enough.</p>

            <p>I am here to tell you, to remind you, it is going to get better. It always does. I know you’re in a dark place, your vision is clouded. There is suddenly no light at the end of the tunnel. It feels like you’re just drowning in gray clouds. Everything is void of color, and it seems like it is going to stay that way. But you’re wrong.</p>
<p>Just stop and breathe. Do the 5-7-8 breathing. Close your eyes and think of someone who loves you. Then think of someone else who loves you. And someone else. Did you notice you came up with  <em>three</em>  people who love you? I’m sure you could come up with many more, too. You are not alone, not in any way.</p>
<p>I know it seems like some people don’t understand, and truthfully, they don’t. No one can completely understand how you feel. You’re you and you’re unique, just like your mind. People will tell you they’ve had similar experiences and you should listen to their stories. You can always learn something from other’s lives. But stop expecting yourself to be able to explain how you feel. It’s impossible. There are no words you can piece together to exactly describe how you feel. Sure, there are words (hopeless, alone, worthless, etc.) that can help people understand better. But you have got to stop expecting people to understand. No matter how much you want them to. That only hurts you more.</p>
<p>I’m telling you this because I know how much time you can waste trying to explain yourself to people. When you dwell on ways to describe your feelings, you’re dwelling on terrible thoughts that just are not true. You will of course be reminded by people that you’re loved, brilliant, never alone and worth more than gold, but you need to remind yourself, too. When you believe that is when things start to change. It’s so funny how many times you will hear those words describing you and you just laugh. Well, I’m here to tell you to stop laughing. Start smiling and be gracious. Start accepting compliments because you deserve them.</p>
<p>When someone tells you how beautiful you are, how amazing you are, how life-changing you are — look that person in the eyes. Cry if you have to, but accept these things are true. That person was always right about you. You are an incredible person who deserves to believe in herself. You deserve and  <em>need</em>  to know you’re not alone.</p>
<p><strong>You are loved</strong>.</p>
<p>Don’t ever forget that. No matter how much it might feel true, it’s not. None of those terrible things you think about yourself are even remotely true.</p>
<p>Most of all, don’t be afraid to speak up. Don’t be scared to tell someone how you feel. Don’t let anyone push you around. Don’t let anyone try to change you for any reason.</p>
<p><strong>Love yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>I hope — I know — life is going to get better. I know you’re crying right now because you’re reading these things you don’t want to believe. But believe them. You are every ounce as amazing as I told you, plus about a billion ounces more. You are never alone. You are never not loved. You are never worthless.</p>
<p>You are incredible. You are amazing. You’re going to change the world. You’re going to change lives. You’re going to leave a mark on the world, whether it’s on the kids you teach or someone else, people will know you were there. People will remember you long after you’re gone.</p>
<p>You are so incredibly important. So stop reading, close your computer, turn on some good music and smile at yourself. Don’t stop until you realize how beautiful you are. Look around and I can guarantee someone you love is right outside your closed door.</p>

            <p>For some reason I thought I responded to your reply. I’m really sorry that I didn’t! Forgive me, lol.</p>
<p>You’re right, I really can’t change others opinions about me. But, it’s life, we really can’t change the thoughts of others. I’ve been good at shutting others opinions out, because at the end of the day, it’s not like I’ll see them in 20 years or so, we will all be categorized with our own individual lives. I been hanging out with people I care about. I few days ago I went out with friends to the cinema and out for dinner. To be honest, it was really nice, I felt cared for, for once you know? I realized just being by yourself can cause unwanted feelings, you nailed it on that one.</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice, it’s very helpful! Have a great life. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=9" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>

            <p>Honestly, I kinda appreciate that you didn’t say “please don’t kill yourself you’re so special” type of stuff. I don’t know why, but even though you’re a stranger, it kinda felt nice to hear things straight forward. You’re right,I’ll be honest. I need to get myself out of that zone, because things will only get more difficult if I dwell on it.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your experiences, it takes bravery to admit that. I never done alcohol or heavy drugs, only weed (I’ve quit, don’t worry). I have learned that a negative attitude can effect those around you, and mostly likely, they’ll feel the same way…give or take.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for this piece of advice. I’m gonna take it and build that courage, not only for myself but for those around me. Also, I will message you if needed. Note taken!</p>

            <p>Thank you for acknowledging that I really wanted to talk about what has been going on! For some reason, that touched my heart. I can say that things have gotten easier within this past week, I decided to focus more on me. I hope this doesnt sound too…self observant? I also been writing lately, and have also been reminding myself every morning that my existence is appreciated. I also wanted to say, that I’m really sorry about the things you went thru, I really hope things are better now and that you’re in a happy state. My heart hurts for you. On the whole “finding one thing to get you thru” thing, I would say the little things that people wouldn’t normally think about, that we are gifted one day at a time.</p>
<p>Your words made my evening. I really appreciate it. <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> I will definitely keep you updated in the future!</p>
<p>Have a nice life, friend.</p>

            <p>Not gonna sugar coat it, the feeling of depression is a choice. You can pull yourself away from it. I was depressed most of my teenage years and finally one day I had a realization - I am letting myself feel this way. I learned to replace bad habits with good habits, I learned that if I am feeling down watch something that does the complete opposite. For me it was comedy movies or comedy  skits on youtube. - Taking and learning that feeling is apart of growth. I’ve been homeless a couple times between the time I was 18-19, I learned that people can be extremely kind and extremely evil. I fell into addiction from 19 to 23, alcohol and drugs, from that I learned that the circle you keep around you reflects on how you feel and act.</p>
<p>If you keep saying you want to be dead, guess what you’re encouraging yourself to continue down that path.  The way to beat depression is building a sense of courage, keeping positive and expecting to get beaten down by life and continuing to move forward when you think you can’t. Picture what you want in you’re head and execute what makes you happy.</p>
<p>Don’t burn you’re world down, build it. - Feel free to message me, on here when you need help. I’ll respond as quick as I can -</p>

            <p>First off, kudos on taking the first step to reach out and express what you’re going through. That alone takes strength my dear friend and I applaud you. As you can tell there are others who have been through similar experiences and as a fellow brother and human being I can sympathize with what you’re going through. I know there are no words that I can say to ease the day-to-day pain. And even then the truth is it will take a while to get past it. But mark my words my good sir, this will pass. And believe me when I say the elation at the end of it all is so much worth fighting to work through this difficult time and get out of this dark place. I don’t know about anyone else’s experience but personally I have been through losing a fiancé, losing my livelihood, losing a loved one and being beaten and robbed all in the span of a year. I have been through the negative comments from family, friends and co-workers. At some point, I wanted to reboot my career and to do so I had to take grade 11 and grade 12 courses (after 2 university degrees and a diploma mind you) in an actual high school (I was 26 at the time). And I’ll be honest it was tough. For me, the one thing that got me through was my cousin. Not everyone will have one, but it’s good to find that one person who will always root for you.</p>
<p>So my good sir, after all is said and done, it is so worth it to fight and make it through this dark period of your life. I know it may sound like made-up words but believe me every word I have said is true. You’re stronger than you give yourself credit. And when you make it out of this dark place you will know that for a fact.</p>
<p>Keep us posted on things are going and if you ever need that random person to chat with, I’m sure anyone in this community would be happy to chat myself included.</p>
