    <title>A forensics repo?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/a-forensics-repo/12157</link>
    <description>Hey,

A few days ago I stumbled upon an image forensics tool which was excellent at what it does in terms of identifying data of an image, however I was wondering whether anybody knows any good GitHub forensics repo&#39;s that has a bunch of different tools that may be used for a forensic analysis. What I mean by this is, recovering / viewing history of deleted files, scanning files or directories, preview of data from a disk and a lot more.

Let me know if you know any repo&#39;s that have a good list! :smiley:</description>

            <p>IMO <a href="https://github.com/Cugu/awesome-forensics" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Cugu/awesome-forensics</a> is one of the best repos out there for that. Anything with an awesome in it is supposed to be a curated list of good references on github. I hope it helps.</p>
