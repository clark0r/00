            <p>Yep it’s basicaly a Segfault, the best way is to run the code in valgrind if you are on linux, and check memory alocation and size that you write. It could just be that you went too far in your</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">unsigned char buff[17];
</code></pre>
<p>Valgrind is your friend, if you need help pm me</p>

            <p>The best way to write self-modifying code is writing one that works (this is the secret!). If you’re getting an access violation, it means that it’s access or writing data where it’s not allowed. Have you checked that the page where <code>TestFunction</code> executes has the executable protection? If it does, then I assume some instructions are triggering the violation. Check that the instructions are correct and whatever data you are accessing actually exists.</p>
