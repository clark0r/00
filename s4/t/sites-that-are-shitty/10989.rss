    <description>I have been spending a lot of time on the World Wide Web and I have stumbled upon a few ugly websites. The most ugly of them so far is [Malware Wiki](http://malware.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page). This thread is mainly about us sharing and laughing and cringing at how ugly these sites are, both at the UI and at the source code level.</description>

            <p>GeoCities is what you’re looking for. Yahoo has taken it down, but a bunch of people, namely the Archive Team, managed to crawl, download and share it on TPB. If you don’t  wanna download a 900GB Torrent and you’re just looking for some nostalgia, Google Images would probably be a good alternative.</p>
