    <title>How do I distribute my headless nodejs script to hundreds of VMs all over the world?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/how-do-i-distribute-my-headless-nodejs-script-to-hundreds-of-vms-all-over-the-world/16476</link>
    <description>Hi there! I have a simple nodejs script that I want to be run on hundreds of virtual machines/IPs all over the world. The script is an automated bot that visits a URL and clicks a specific link on the page. I would like to also be able to control the interval in which these events are happening, and how many times this is happening. What would be the best way to go about this? What services would I have to use?</description>
