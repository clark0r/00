    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/how-to-disable-2fa-authenticator-app-if-you-have-deleted-the-app/12500</link>
    <description>How do you disable 2FA - authenticator app, once you have enabled it. I have lost the authenticator app, so i can&#39;t generate any more authentication codes. But I have my password and access to my mail. Is there any option to generate new QR code for the authenticator app ?</description>

            <p>There is no way to recover a key once you have deleted your app, so you are in trouble. 0x00sec make it a bit difficult, because if you lose that app you lose everything.</p>

            <p>You talking about a Google account. If you have your phone number linked to the account you can use that for your 2FA. Or submit an account access ticket. This takes a couple of days, but can assist you logging in to your account. All these options come up on the 2 step verification page when you log in.</p>
