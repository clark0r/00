    <description>Welcome back my trainee command-line ninjas! 

In this guide we will be covering some basic concepts and tricks to sending files to computers in the Linux shell. This can be extremely useful when you&#39;re trying to share a backdoored executable to a machine on the same network, but don&#39;t want to have the hassle of uploading to Dropbox, or Google Drive, or any other file sharing site when all you have is a shell. This puzzled me for a long time until I found a few simple ways of sharing files.

### Key:
In these examples I will use some things as placeholders, these things will change depending on your use case
 
- file.tar.gz - this is the file I will be sharing, this can be anything.
- 192.168.1.2 - This is the server (sending machine IP)
- 2020 - this is the port I am sharing the data over.

## Method 1 - Using netcat

This method uses data redirection and pipes to transfer data. Both devices must be on the same LAN, technically this can work across the internet, but really isn&#39;t worth it in this instance (unless its a [VPS](https://0x00sec.org/t/want-a-vps-use-our-affiliate-link/335)). 

On the sending machine (or the server) you just need to locate the file and be in the same working directory, and then execute:

```
cat file.tar.gz | nc -l -p 2020
```

You can use any file within reason, and any port number above 1024 (without root privledges), you must also make sure that the port is open on the server machine, by default without a firewall it should be open, although if you have a UFW firewall you can run `ufw allow 2020`, and if you&#39;re using an IPTables firewall, you can run `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2020 -j ACCEPT`.

Now on the receiving machine, you just need to run
 
```
nc 192.168.1.2 2020 &gt; file.tar.gz
```

You can find the IP address of your sending (server) machine by running `ifconfig` on the sending (server) machine. 

This is all fine and dandy, and will work, but how the hell do I know the progress? You can easily impliment a `pv` into this pipe, and use it to report the progress. You will usually need to install `pv`. (Infomation on installing packages can be found [here](https://0x00sec.org/t/trix-with-linux-0x01-basic-linux-use/804))

Simply run:

```
pv file.tar.gz | nc -l -p 2020 
```

This will present you with a progress bar and ETA as well as the rate of transfer. 


## Method 2 - Using Python 
So now you&#39;re thinking &#39;Well that&#39;s pretty awesome! But what if the client machine isn&#39;t a Linux box with a shell?&#39;

**Do not fear, for _Python_ is here**

This example is just as cool, although does require you have python installed on the sending machine/server. Firstly, you need to determine what version of Python you have installed with:

```
python --version
```

Now this will either reply:
`Python 2.x.x`

or 

`Python 3.x.x`

This is very important because if you don&#39;t run the right command, it won&#39;t work at all. Now, navigate to the directory where you file is and...

### Python2 
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

### Python3 
```
python -m http.server
```

This will reply with `Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...`

Now on your client (recieving) machine, you just need to navigate in a browser to `192.168.1.2:8000/file.tar.gz`, and it will begin downloading.  Another way you can do this is by using wget, you can run

```
wget &quot;http://192.168.1.2:8000/file.tar.gz&quot;
```

So I hope you enjoyed this article! Stay tuned for the next installment of Trix&#39; with Linux!

            <p>Not at all. I generally use curl because it automatically prints the output to stdout. With wget you need a few flags. Plus curl is normally installed by default on most machines</p>

            <p>I’ve actually figured out a new way. Which is insanely cool.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">cat file.scaryextension | gzip | base64 | nc termbin.com 9999
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">curl http://termbin.com/url | base64 -d | gzip -d &gt; file.scaryextension
</code></pre>
<p>Actually using this method means, any place that will store text, will store full on files indirectly through base64, This means even your bio on your 0x00sec profile can potentially store files xD</p>

            <p>Welcome back my trainee command-line ninjas!</p>
<p>In this guide we will be covering some basic concepts and tricks to sending files to computers in the Linux shell. This can be extremely useful when you’re trying to share a backdoored executable to a machine on the same network, but don’t want to have the hassle of uploading to Dropbox, or Google Drive, or any other file sharing site when all you have is a shell. This puzzled me for a long time until I found a few simple ways of sharing files.</p>
<h3>Key:</h3>
<p>In these examples I will use some things as placeholders, these things will change depending on your use case</p>
<ul>
<li>file.tar.gz - this is the file I will be sharing, this can be anything.</li>
<li>192.168.1.2 - This is the server (sending machine IP)</li>

<p>You can use any file within reason, and any port number above 1024 (without root privledges), you must also make sure that the port is open on the server machine, by default without a firewall it should be open, although if you have a UFW firewall you can run <code>ufw allow 2020</code>, and if you’re using an IPTables firewall, you can run <code>iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2020 -j ACCEPT</code>.</p>
<p>Now on the receiving machine, you just need to run</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">nc 192.168.1.2 2020 &gt; file.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<p>You can find the IP address of your sending (server) machine by running <code>ifconfig</code> on the sending (server) machine.</p>
<p>This is all fine and dandy, and will work, but how the hell do I know the progress? You can easily impliment a <code>pv</code> into this pipe, and use it to report the progress. You will usually need to install <code>pv</code>. (Infomation on installing packages can be found <a href="https://0x00sec.org/t/trix-with-linux-0x01-basic-linux-use/804">here</a>)</p>
<p>Simply run:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">pv file.tar.gz | nc -l -p 2020 
</code></pre>
<p>This will present you with a progress bar and ETA as well as the rate of transfer.</p>
<h2>Method 2 - Using Python</h2>
<p>So now you’re thinking ‘Well that’s pretty awesome! But what if the client machine isn’t a Linux box with a shell?’</p>
<p><strong>Do not fear, for <em>Python</em> is here</strong></p>
<p>This example is just as cool, although does require you have python installed on the sending machine/server. Firstly, you need to determine what version of Python you have installed with:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">python --version
</code></pre>
<p>Now this will either reply:<br>
<code>Python 2.x.x</code></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>Python 3.x.x</code></p>
<p>This is very important because if you don’t run the right command, it won’t work at all. Now, navigate to the directory where you file is and…</p>
<h3>Python2</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">python -m SimpleHTTPServer
</code></pre>
<h3>Python3</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">python -m http.server
</code></pre>
<p>This will reply with <code>Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...</code></p>
<p>Now on your client (recieving) machine, you just need to navigate in a browser to <code>192.168.1.2:8000/file.tar.gz</code>, and it will begin downloading.  Another way you can do this is by using wget, you can run</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">wget "http://192.168.1.2:8000/file.tar.gz"
</code></pre>
