    <description>Hi 0x00ers! 

I hope you&#39;ve had a great weekend! For me, in the UK it is a bank holiday today so I&#39;m going to be working away quietly on this box on my day off slight_smile:

The past few weeks it seems we&#39;ve had a bit of a deviation of routine on these weekly hacktheboxes as a group, so this week should be the week we get back on the wagon and continue our rigorous training routine :slight_smile:

## Box Info
This is a practically brand new box and is rated hard, it has quite a lot of points attributed to it, but the user ratings are that its fairly easy. We shall see! It is also a Linux box so that should be fun for a lot of us Linux people :slight_smile:

Release Date: 20th April 2019
