    <title>What&#39;s the latest in 0x00sec?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/whats-the-latest-in-0x00sec/1126</link>
    <description>Let&#39;s just say I have been away for a while. Been working on my pretty obvious personal site so I had to cancel a few of my 0x00sec projects since anyone would be able to compare it with my current one (Or accuse me of plagiarism :p) 

I&#39;ve met up with a new partner in crime and have taken another person under my wing to show them what I know. 

Hope to meet all the newcomers and see the old ones again soon :)</description>
