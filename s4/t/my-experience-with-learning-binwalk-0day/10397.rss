    <description>### How I found a Vulnerability using binwalk (0day included)

While attempting to teach myself how to use binwalk from [this](https://p16.praetorian.com/blog/getting-started-with-damn-vulnerable-router-firmware-dvrf-v0.1) tutorial by Praetorian, I ran into a few problems with the firmware. So I decided, &quot;Fuck it! We&#39;ll do it live!&quot;
Since I&#39;ve been working in the Healthcare industry and would be reverse-engineer medical devices for future assignments, I decided to just get started now. 
#### Required Skills

To completely understand the content of this article, the following lists pre-requisite knowledge:

* General Linux Knowledge


### Let&#39;s get Started
I looked for some firmware and came across [this]( https://www.atredis.com/blog/2018/5/14/ge-healthcare-mac-5500-vulnerabilities) article.
Atredis found a few vulnerabilities in two devices, GE Healthcare MAC5500 EEG, and the Silex SDS-500, SD-320AN linux-based WiFi bridges.

They found some OS Injections in the SD-320AN, which I thought was pretty cool. Silex updated their firmware, so these vulnerabilities shouldn&#39;t be present. Atredis also shared a link on the current version of the firmware, so after the patch.
I wanted to know what would happen if I ran binwalk on the updated firmware. (I still didn&#39;t know how binwalk worked).

After running binwalk, I got a layout of a linux filesystem.

![22%20PM|445x500](upload://v9eySxZgo88Q4zgJz4WzHtbVBln.png) 

From here, I usually just go straight to **/etc/passwd**

&gt; root:x:0:0:root:/tmp:/bin/sh
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh
sync:x:4:100:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/spool/mail:/bin/sh
proxy:x:13:13:proxy:/bin:/bin/sh
www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/bin/sh
backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/bin/sh
operator:x:37:37:Operator:/var:/bin/sh
haldaemon:x:68:68:hald:/:/bin/sh
dbus:x:81:81:dbus:/var/run/dbus:/bin/sh
ftp:x:83:83:ftp:/home/ftp:/bin/sh
nobody:x:99:99:nobody:/home:/bin/sh
sshd:x:103:99:Operator:/var:/bin/sh
admin:x:1001:1001:Linux User:/tmp/jail/tmp:/usr/bin/console

This wasn&#39;t that much help. So then I looked at **/etc/shadow**

&gt; root::10933:0:99999:7:::
bin:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
daemon:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
adm:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
lp:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
sync:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
shutdown:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
halt:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
uucp:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
operator:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
ftp:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
nobody:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
admin:tVMhrdFrEt866:0:0:99999:7:::

You notice the password for admin?
tVMhrdFrEt866

I thought this was a hash so I plugged it into [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/). A great website that has a ton of hashes already there.

![39%20PM|690x276](upload://eklFnPWkoXCr6TP9kpuRLboZXoh.png) 

&quot;Unrecognized hash format.&quot; So...it&#39;s not a hash.
After a few moments, I thought about just throwing it into a [base64 decoder](https://www.base64decode.org/).

Base64 decoded tVMhrdFrEt866 as S!k:

### Conclusion:
All in all, from grabbing the firmware, to running binwalk (poorly. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m underutilizing it&#39;s potential.), and plugging this encoded string into a hash lookup and decoder, this entire process took me only about 2 hours. I spent more time being afraid of trying things in the wild, than I did actually discovering things. If you ever want to try or get into something, but want to build your skills up first, I suggest, if it&#39;s harmless like this, just do it. You&#39;ll learn. If it has some legal or criminal implications, then maybe you should spend more time in the Information Gathering and Recon phases. But this is harmless. Mostly.</description>

            <p>Yeah, sadly embedded devices usually have backdoor passwords. They don’t even go to the troubler of making a decent backdoor, they just add a user.</p>
