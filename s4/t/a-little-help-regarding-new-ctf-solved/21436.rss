    <title>A little help regarding new CTF [Solved]</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/a-little-help-regarding-new-ctf-solved/21436</link>
    <description>Hello elites,

I am pretty new to the world of hacking and penetration testing. I just want to pursue my carrer as a security specialist and am just getting started. I have done a couple of simple CTF challenges, just for beginners. I joined 2-3 forums for getting community support and learning new stuff.

As I searched along some sites I encountered HackersAcademy and their courses. Recently they announed a new CTF challenge and those who solve the challenge will get their KALI Linux course for free. Since I&#39;m from  a relatively poorer country me taking the course of $300 is unthinkable. I have tried around 3 hours already looking up various tutorials in the net for solving but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve achieved anything. I wonder if any of the members here could mentor or guide me or help me in solving the CTF Challenge . I would be eternally grateful. I know it sounds too bad to ask help for such a thing but I think it makes a lot sense to me.

Thank you.</description>
