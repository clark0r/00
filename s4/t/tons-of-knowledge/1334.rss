    <description>Hi,

I hope this doesn&#39;t count as spam already, if so, please contact me, admins.
After I found the [NSA Tools](https://0x00sec.org/t/blue-team-tools-made-by-nsa/1331/4) on GitHub, I looked around a bit further. I finally found an awesome[ collection of Computer Science course videos](https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses/blob/master/README.md), from really high-level universities such as MIT.
There is an endless array of topics, so I am sure everyone here will at least find one topic he&#39;s interested in.
