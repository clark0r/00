    <title>Robotics CTF, a playground for robot hacking</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/robotics-ctf-a-playground-for-robot-hacking/9015</link>
    <description>For those interested in robotics and following from https://0x00sec.org/t/robot-vulnerability-scoring-system-rvss/8661 and https://0x00sec.org/t/robot-hacking-the-robot-security-framework-rsf/7922, I&#39;m happy to share a recent work we&#39;ve made available called the Robotics CTF (or simple RCTF for short):

&lt;img src=&#39;//0x00sec.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/f/ff701a5a53a694ac8243969b9a94c5a21fc890e5.jpeg&#39;&gt;

&gt; The Robotics CTF is a platform for robot hacking. It provides online robotic simulation environment, accessible from any browser, 24/7 and from anywhere in the world. Through the RCTF, security researchers can familiarize with typical robotic vulnerabilities without having access to real robots.

The whole infrastructure is available online and accessible through https://aliasrobotics.com/ctf.htm. A simple account is required to access the different scenarios which are constantly being built. A list of the public scenarios is available at https://github.com/aliasrobotics/rctf-list. This repository includes also tools to reproduce RCTF scenarios locally  (each scenario is containerized with Docker) so that you can experiment yourself. 

A few links for those that wish to learn more:
- [Robotics CTF site](https://rctf.aliasrobotics.com/)
- [Article introducing the Robotics CTF](https://aliasrobotics.com/research/rctf.htm) in Alias Robotics website
- [Original white paper about the RCTF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02690.pdf)
- [Github repository with the Robotics CTF scenarios](https://github.com/aliasrobotics/rctf-list)

Feedback and contributions are welcome.</description>
