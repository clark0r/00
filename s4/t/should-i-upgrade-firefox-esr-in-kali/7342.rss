    <title>Should I upgrade Firefox ESR in Kali?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/should-i-upgrade-firefox-esr-in-kali/7342</link>
    <description>Curious of opinions on the use of Firefox ESR versus upgrading to Firefox Quantum (latest) in Kali. I’ve seen posts recommending to upgrade Firefox to Quantum while I’ve spoken to people who feel that using ESR has advantages since it won’t have the same fixes or architectural security features of the latest browser. 

Would love your thoughts.</description>

            <p>No.</p>
<p>Don’t.</p>
<p>Well. That’s just my opinion. The main reason I think that Kali bundled with ESR to begin with, is that it’s compatible with a lot of the add-ons it’s always used, like Hackbar, useragent switcher and things like that.</p>
<p>Some of these add-ons haven’t upgraded to the new Firefox yet. So they’ll break.</p>
