### Realistic challenge 2
&gt;Message: I have been informed that you have quite admirable hacking skills. Well, this racist hate group is using their website to organize a mass gathering of ignorant racist bastards. We cannot allow such bigoted aggression to happen. If you can gain access to their administrator page and post messages to their main page, we would be eternally grateful.

#### What can extract from the message?
There seems to be a hidden administrator page? So let&#39;s find it ;) 


### The site:
**NOTE:** The site displays nazi symbols and texts, so be careful :D 
[spoiler]

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/9/94f14a5b51f9fa07d90a94ccff055bc82ac4a7c4.png&quot; width=&quot;674&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
[/spoiler]

### the source
The source code of the site is not worth pasting here. Just a bunch of formatting, headers, pictures etc. 
Except one line!

**note:** Due to the formatting pasting the code correctly here won&#39;t display it. As a workaround a screenshot is used instead!

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/5/59e58943fc003e1c6a210d15c8eb7629a05f57e7.png&quot; width=&quot;493&quot; height=&quot;53&quot;&gt;

If we follow this **update.php** we get to a page looking like this:

&lt;img src=&quot;//0x00sec.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/a/aa89477e36da6b66aa937c5cda2f51758c184d0a.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;270&quot;&gt;

### The &#39;hack&#39;
[spoiler]
####So what could we do now?
Well the first thing that might come to mind is brute forcing our way in and try all the standard passwords combinations we can think of ( admin/admin, admin/password, .......).
This seems too much work so we can try the following:

username **AND** password are the following:  &#39; or &#39;1&#39;=&#39;1
So why the heck is it like this???

The answer is easy when logging in here your username and password will be matched against a database and the &quot;partially more complete&quot; expression which gets evaluated looks like this:

    something something... name=&#39;OURCODEHERENOW&#39; and password=&#39;OURCODEHERENOW&#39;
So if we add our login credentials there it&#39;ll look like:

    something something... name=&#39;&#39; or &#39;1&#39;=&#39;1&#39; and password=&#39;&#39; or &#39;1&#39;=&#39;1&#39;

####So what did we do? 
We told the update.php script to evaluate this expression, which says username is empty or TRUE and the password is empty or TRUE, which always results in TRUE because of boolean logic.
[/spoiler]


# Conclusions
This little &#39;real challenge&#39; deals with 2 problems.
 [spoiler]First you have to find some kind of login interface and secondly when you found it you have to think how to *crack* the username and password, but in reality and quick check for SQL injection makes our life way easier :slight_smile:[/spoiler]
That&#39;s all for this challenge. 
This little exploitation can always come in handy if parsing of the inputs is not handled properly :smiley: 

The next article of the series can be found [here](https://0x00sec.org/t/hts-org-r3-challenge/) once it&#39;s up!!

            <p>I’ll add them right away. It’s a bit tricky tho. You can access the “level” without an accout it seems but for the page where the ‘message’ is given to you with the task itself you need to have an account… sigh<br>
But since I’m providing the message here it shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>EDIT: added links to all challenges which are acessible without an account. If you submit your passwords it’s likely that you’ll get an error.</p>

            <p>I found it nice to have the spoiler tags because I now try the challenges on my own. If you remove them, maybe add a spoiler warning and some spaces <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>haha thanks. I thought I put in a spoiler for the actual ‘hacking section’ so the viewer can think about the possible attacks/exploits on his/her own first before just mindlessly reading what I wrote.<br>
But if this spoiler thing is a huge distraction as a viewer I will remove it!<br>

            <p>Gotta say man. I love the concept of the storyline​ with these. One thing I would say as a suggestion, would be not to spoiler tag the method, since we’re probably going to read it anyway <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
