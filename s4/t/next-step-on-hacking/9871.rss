            <p>So I’m going to chime in from a different perspective and say that one shouldn’t aim to be good at “hacking” per se because it’s really just a mindset. When you think outside the box and apply your skills in ways that weren’t expected, that’s hacking. When you decide you want to rewrite a program because you believe you can do it better, that (to me) is still hacking. Hacking is creating, improving, disassembling, breaking, and much much more.</p>
<p>There are folks we revere as “hackers” who aren’t anything like traditional Hollywood Hackers at all. Think differently.</p>
<p>For more explicit direction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enumerate your current skills/abilities</li>
<li>For each one, evaluate whether it could be abused to gain access, breach trust, etc</li>
<li>Examine this further and begin researching examples where this particular skill or ability was abused</li>
</ol>
<p>There was a blind kid in the 80’s with perfect pitch who whistled his way into manipulating Ma Bell’s phone systems. They were a very large telecom conglomerate in America at the time. Who knew that simply being able to whistle a certain tone could break a phone system? That’s definitely hacking.</p>

            <p>No problem!</p>
<p>IRC is another good resource to learn new things here, but again don’t expect to have your hand held</p>
<p>Welcome to the community!</p>
<p>Note: I didn’t see an introduction topic for yourself on the forum, put yourself out there and say hello!</p>

            <p>I’m sure others will pipe in with this: 0x00sec is a great community to learn if you put in the effort; there won’t be any hand-holding.  Just start reading topics that interest you on the forum and dig into any areas that you don’t know about.</p>
<p>Never stop reading is the best advice I can give you</p>
<p>Edit: Hack the Box is a good way to practice what you know; there is a post somewhere on the forum about joining the 0x00sec HTB team</p>
