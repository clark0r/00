    <title>VPS or a VPN for a RAT?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/vps-or-a-vpn-for-a-rat/10973</link>
    <description>I only have one RAT license and I was wondering if a VPS would be the best viable option to interact with my RAT. I was thinking of getting a VPN and then buying a VPS and only connecting with that VPN. Does anyone suggest anything better or is this alright?</description>
