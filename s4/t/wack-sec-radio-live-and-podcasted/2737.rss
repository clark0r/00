            <p>the live video feed requires flash player unless you get the younow mobile app but then you need an account which is free and no ads. the web player on <a href="http://wickedradio.net" rel="nofollow noopener">wickedradio.net</a> is html5 and there are shoutcast links depending on the flavor of player you use. the wacksec radio show will air fridays at 8pm central time anytime im in IRC as DeshiMcDorgle you can be assured I am on the radio show on all platforms. I am open to new shows all you need is broadcast software and are not required to go on video that is just something i been doing for a long time.</p>
