    <title>Do you wanna write some malware?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/do-you-wanna-write-some-malware/1812</link>
    <description>I think that it would be a good exercise for y&#39;all (myself included) to write some decent malware.

I&#39;ve been rolling the concept for one around in my head for a few weeks and it would be fun to implement, especially with a small team of people working on it.

Here&#39;s a basic concept that is in no way full fleshed-out. The current project name is **Murmur**.

* Modular - can be expanded at runtime with more modules
* Basic functionality has small binary
* Updatable
* Hides in legitimate dll in process
* Can spread across network
* Uses dns requests for basic communication
* Http for more complex/large communications
* Conceals data in images for communications
* Collects info, passwords, keystrokes, screenshots, etc
* Organized by encrypted, compressed files

Communication

* Client
 * Uses dns requests to send small amounts of data periodically
 * Uses https POST to send larger data
 * Uses https GET to get modules or commands
 * Encapsulates communications in images
* Server
 * Puts received data into encrypted archives for collection
 * Has front website to seem legit
 * Encrypted Virtual File System
 * Stores files in a virtual file system
 * Stores modules, data that needs to be sent to C&amp;C, configuration

I have experience with smaller projects, but this would be much, much larger than anything I&#39;ve worked on by myself.
If people would like to work on this with me, send a pm my way and I&#39;ll organize a team.</description>

            <p>Yeah, automation of its operation would be nice.</p>
<p>I don’t want to use python, the interpreter is too large.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be overly difficult to use dlls as modules so it can be expanded on the fly.</p>

            <p>I’m not so experienced with Python, but isn’t it very unstealthy when running on Windows? If not, I think we could create modules/packages with it, but leave the core in C++. Anyways, looking forward to this project! I always had something similar in mind, and my head is sparkling full of ideas! <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=9" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"><br>
Maybe we should do it on our GitLab?</p>

            <p>I would suggest part of the concept would be that a lot of things, (data collection, surveillance) would be mostly automated. It could create packages (organized by date) that will upload periodically.</p>
<p>If designed well, it could be designed to operate on a very large scale, with a P2P C&amp;C server. The package idea also would allow for future expansion with air-gaps, offline etc.</p>
<p>I don’t want to sound like that guy, but python could be a very good choice. STELF is written in python, and pyinstaller does an extraordinarily good job. Much better than I ever dreamed it to be.</p>
<p>What sort of scale is intended for this project, what would be different about this piece of malware, and how can we creatively incorporate new ideas to this?</p>
<p>I’m excited to see this come to fruition. I hope it does and not just fade away as some projects do <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
