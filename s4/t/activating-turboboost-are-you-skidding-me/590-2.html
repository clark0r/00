    <title>Activating Turboboost, are you skidding me?</title>
    <link>https://d.clarkee.co.uk/t/activating-turboboost-are-you-skidding-me/590</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve noticed something over the years: you should never trust your doctor blindly.
In fact, don&#39;t trust anyone merely because they are an &quot;expert&quot; or a &quot;professional.&quot;

There is this idea that certain things can only be understood with a degree.
It&#39;s funny, the misconception that a degree defines understanding.
See what&#39;s going on here? or where I&#39;m going with this?

Too often I see a very cool article to which everyone replies, 
&quot;Nice article, but it&#39;s too advanced for me.&quot;

Really? Did you do any research?
Or did you just see some weird syntax and/or some unfamiliar words?

Let go of this humbleness / insecurity / no-can-do mentality. You can do far more than you think.
I try to leave some clues in my articles, saying that it just takes some reading and research,  _not_ a Nobel Prize, to grasp the concepts.

Just make an effort; it will be worth it.

I&#39;ll start a series on how to self-educate.

And when it comes to Bash, I always man a command that I don’t recognize before I use it xD.</p>

            <p>It depends on what the person wants to say when writing “it’s too advanced for me.”<br>
If they mean that the subject looks to hard so they never gonna try it because they’re sure they won’t be able to understand it, then it’s a bad thing. You should never give up just after looking at a topic. While at that, you should never give up AT ALL if your learning something you’re interested in. A saying in IT is “reboot, retry”. Do that. Over and over again. Go back to where you strayed off your path and resume. You will eventually reach your goal. Don’t limit yourself by saying it is “too complicated”, “too much” or just not “on your skill level”.</p>
<p>But there is another possibility.<br>
Learning is (mostly) based on increments. First you learn the very basics, then the advanced stuff and finally you master something. So the sentence could also mean “it’s too advanced for me, YET”. They could be already actively learning stuff concerning a topic or are planning to do that, but the article itself might be considered “advanced” or “master”, they just express their liking of the article while admitting that they have a long way to go before fully comprehending the article.<br>
So I’d say it’s not always a bad thing when people say something like that (btw.: mind giving links to some negative examples here at 0x00sec? - I’m curious).</p>

<p>The other advantage I have found about using different sources is that you quickly identify the key points. Those central to most of the resources are the important stuff and you easily assimilate what is relevant and what not.</p>

            <p>I guess you’re both right.<br>
It’s a behaviour I encountered a lot up to this date and it’s not related to Hacking only. For example: I study arabic and when the stuff got a lot tougher i saw so many people drop out just because it involved more work.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that a lot of people seem to be overwhelmed by information that they cant sort out instantly. I guess they think they have to understand everything instantly. But in my opinion you don’t have to. The more you learn, the more all the pieces of information start falling together and create the bigger picture which is quite necessary for advanced stuff.<br>
And i think it’s partially because of the way people are raised and (mis)eduacated. I dont know how education is organized where y’all are from but in my country there is no emphasis on autodidactic skills.</p>
<p>Nothing worth doing or getting is accomplished easy in my opinion.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@unh0lys0da</span> I think your series on self education is a very good idea</p>

            <p>“If you never failed, you never tried anything new”. That’s one of the quotes that keep me going when I delve into something completely out of my comfort zone. If you don’t expose yourself to new ideas you will never grow. Neither mentally or personally.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t recommend self researching as the first step. What is crucial to research is curiosity. You have to find what you enjoy doing and just go at it. Once you do that, self research will come by itself. Your passion will drive you towards it. Sometimes it may feel like you found the one thing you love but right when shit gets rough you start doubting. It’s normal to doubt. If it was easy, everybody would do it. As <a class="mention" href="https://d.clarkee.co.uk/u/0x00pf">@0x00pf</a> said, DOING will teach you a lot. Theory is all good to get you started but if you don’t sit your ass down and explore by doing you will never really get to know the subject that interests you.</p>
<p>Just get up, find something you love, prepare yourself to fail multiple times, learn from your failures, go back at it and fail again and again. Trust the process. Keep on going and think of why you started. Each time you fail, you are one step closer to success. Also don’t be afraid to ask. Those who don’t ask stay fools forever. Stay on the grind and keep on learning and researching.</p>
<p>Once you find your why, you will find the way to make it happen. Personally, most of the time I spend is dedicated to research so I can find multiple resources to learn from. NEVER use only one resource for learning. Personally, I have around 6-8 tutorial playlists/books for whatever I’m interested in and I go back and forth in case one of them misses to explain something the other playlists doesn’t. This magical feeling after understanding something that seemed too complicated in the first place is just out of this world.</p>
<p>There is nothing to be afraid of while walking a new path. If you think about it, you never lose, you always gain something out of it. Every negative situation contains the possibility of a positive outcome. It’s how you look at it that matters. Don’t wait for the moment to “feel like it”. Deal with it now because the clock is ticking and it’s your only opponent in life.</p>

            <p>This is a very good point. It makes me recall my first steps with Arduinos.</p>
<p>For years I knew about the devices but I never tried. All those electronics looked way too advanced to me. It just looked out of scope. But one day I decided to try. Indeed it required a little bit of effort but very quickly I realized that it was a lot simpler that I believed… Actually it was amazingly easy to get started and build simple stuff. It just required a bit of effort and the aim to do it.</p>
<p>Then, you start blinking those LEDs… believe me, the first time it happens is amazing. Progressively you continue with more and more complex projects. At some point you start to look how to build your code outside the Arduino IDE… and again, it is easier than expected… and so on. In the way you learn about quite some stuff while replicating the projects from other people and making your little changes.</p>
<p>There is something special on putting some effort on achieving a goal. Succeeding on that goal is a really grateful experience. Work on something, put some effort, get stuck trying something, search, research, ask, finally solve the problem and then… you see the final result…</p>
<p>On top of this <em>“it feels good”</em> thingy, you will, without noticing it, learn quite some stuff, stuff that you will never learn just reading tutorials on the internet or books. Stuff that is not even directly related to what you were trying to solve. It is not that reading tutorial and books doesn’t work. No, but you need to exercise both sides, because they are two views of a same reality that complements one each other. And reality is, somehow, different for everybody, including the guy that wrote the book or the tutorial <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Some times you may not fully understand what you are doing, but the fact of trying it, will move you into a new position  with a brand new point of view to keep moving, an learn new and awesome stuff <img src="https://0x00sec.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Getting this multiple points of view is, IMHO the best way to really understand what the topic and not just learn a receipt.</p>
<p>But, keep in mind that, it you do not try anything, because it is too difficult,… you are not moving.</p>
<p>This is my view… what does the other members of 0x00sec think about this?</p>
